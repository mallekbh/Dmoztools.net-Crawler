If you do not see a breed listed here, it does not mean that it cannot live in an apartment. This list only covers the breeds considered "best" for apartment life. Do not assume that just because a dog is small that it will get enough exercise running around your home. Your home is like a large cage. If you have a yard, it’s a larger cage. The key to keeping any dog in an apartment is providing enough exercise. Dogs are canine animals that have retained the instinct to migrate. Therefore, even small dogs need to be taken out for daily walks. High-energy dogs can live in an apartment if the owner takes them out for long walks, bike rides or jogs. Enough daily exercise is the key to keeping any dog stable and happy. Be sure it is the right type of exercise, an exercise that drains both the dog’s physical and mental energy. Only providing excited exercise (i.e. playing with other dogs or tossing a ball) does not drain the dog’s mental energy. Find out more—read The Proper Way to Walk a Dog .            NOTE: Almost any dog can live in an apartment, IF...and this is a Big IF...it gets enough of the right kind of exercise. If you plan on jogging with your dog , and as long as you can make the dog heel on the jog so the dog is not worrying about being your leader but rather relaxing as he is following you, you have a very wide range of dogs to choose from. Most dogs in the shelters are there because their owners ONE, did not provide proper leadership and TWO, did not exercise them properly. A big backyard is not going to cut it. So those people who live apartments who actually walk their dogs (assuming they make them heel on the lead) are often better off than those who are simply only let out into the fenced backyard for exercise. Dog park exercise is excited exercise and it is not recommended as the only source of exercise a dog receives. It keeps the dog in an excited state of mind.  There are SO MANY great jogging companions in shelters . If you plan to jog every day then you would even qualify for a higher energy dog even though you are in an apartment. But if you plan on only jogging two or three times a week and plan to only walk the dog the remaining days, I would go with a medium-energy dog.  The thing to remember is it is not necessarily the breed you are looking for but the energy level of that particular dog. There are pups born within every litter that are higher energy than other pups within the same litter, dogs within the same breed that are higher energy than others. That is why some folks will, for example, get a Lab as a pet and think it is wonderful and when that dog passes away, they get another Lab and find the next one to be a nightmare. Their first Lab was low energy and low dominancy and the second one is high and high. Sure, a Pointer is going to always be higher energy than a Clumber Spaniel , but they will still vary from dog to dog within the same breed.

Allen         Studio apartment living has its advantages (there is less area to clean!), but it also has its downside when it comes to storage. Studio apartments (and many college dorms) pose a particular problem due to the fact that all household functions are limited to one room (i.e., eating, entertaining, sleeping, studying). This article will deal with unique solutions for studio apartment living.  Weeding out unnecessary belongings is essential, especially in a studio apartment where space is at a premium. Again, an inventory of the quantity and sizes of your items will also be useful to help tackle your storage needs. Next, decide on a storage option. For studio apartments, I propose the following for your things: hide them, move them, or store them in plain sight. This article will focus on hiding your belongings.        Studio Apartment Hiding Places  Hiding your stuff is a good idea and generally means putting your things inside other stored objects. For this, any hollow item is a potential storage space. For example, we all have suitcases or luggage stored away for vacations and travel. Why store them empty? Inside stored luggage is a great place to save out-of-season clothing or holiday decorations. If you travel a lot, this may be a hassle, but if you are like me, you will only have to empty your suitcases once or twice per year for a trip.  Related: 5 Ways to Live in Small Spaces  Baskets are a decorative way to hide your storage items. Utilize baskets and fill them with sewing supplies, art or office supplies, canned or dry goods, etc. Use baskets with lids so they can be stacked and placed on shelves or on the floor. Baskets are very inexpensive and readily available at garage sales, flea markets, and thrift stores.  Wicker chests and steamer trunks are useful for storage of blankets, table linens, and out-of-season clothing and can be used as coffee- or end-tables. Place them up against a wall near a window, add some cushions, and you have a nice window seat. These chests can also be found inexpensively at resale shops or if you are handy, you could make a storage box or window seat out of 2x4 lumber and press board.     Small Dining Area photo from Shutterstock    Furnishing Your Studio Apartment  If you are just starting out and looking to furnish a studio apartment, consider multi-function furniture as a way to manage your space. Futons or sofa-sleepers are good options, but they are often expensive (although less expensive than buying both a bed and a couch). An inexpensive alternative is to make a daybed out of your existing bed by placing its long side near a wall and adding cushions up against the wall and bolster pillows on each end. This eliminates the need for a couch.  There are also products on the market that allow for built-in drawers under the bed. If you are handy, you can make your own platform bed, but the really inexpensive alternative is to use cardboard or plastic under-bed boxes.  Catalogs such as Hold Everything and Lillian Vernon offer many items for storage, but they can be expensive. Using a little creativity, these catalogs can be great inspiration for more thrifty solutions. For example, either buy an inexpensive metal shelving unit or make one out of 2x4 lumber and press board, then purchase inexpensive muslin fabric (approx. $2 @ yard) or better yet, bed sheets from a garage sale, and create a slipcover for your ugly shelves making them useful and decorative. If one sheet is not big enough, sew several together until you get the right fit. (Don't forget to cut slits up the corners of the cover to make your belongings accessible and add ties so they will close.)  Almost anything can be slip covered to add more decorative storage. I use a long, rectangular card table to hold my computer, monitor, and printer and by throwing a floor-length clean sheet over it, I am able to store extra office supplies, old client files, and all the computer wiring under the table very neatly.   Imagine how much simpler life could be if you were debt free . Now take the first step to getting there .  For really large items that can't be slip covered, put somewhere else, or hidden any other way, there is always the solution of placing a large object in front of it so it won't be seen. I recommend a folding Japanese screen or a cluster of large plants. Screens can be made with inexpensive lumber and covered with paper, fabric, photographs, or lightweight art (this could also be the answer to not having enough wall space for art or photos). Screens are great because they not only hide clutter, but they also offer privacy (especially for one-room living) and add personality to your living space.

When seeking rooms for rent in the USA near school or work, your choices are virtually limitless. This makes our Roommate finder essential. Whether you’re looking for rooms for rent in a college town, a vast metropolis, suburban neighborhoods, or a rural area, you are sure to find success with EasyRoommate. Our Roommate finder helps pair “roommate wanted” offerings with people searching for rooms for rent in the USA’s countless communities. And with the USA’s massive size and wide variety of its many regions, you really have your pick of the type of neighborhood, roommates, and housing you prefer. College communities throughout the USA offer rooms to rent to students year-round. Some homeowners rent out large houses to several renters, while others prefer just to rent a room in their home. City dwellers often share apartments to help make their lifestyles more affordable. You can share the rent costs, allowing you to enjoy the many beneficial features of living in the city, such as museums, galleries, concerts, bars, clubs, restaurants, and much more.         Combined, US public and private 2- and 4-year institutions numbered 4,724 from 2013 to 2014, according to the National Center of Education Statistics (NCES). You can obtain a top-rated education from coast-to-coast in the USA. California’s Institute of Technology and Stanford University, Princeton in New Jersey, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Notre Dame in Indiana were the top 5 rated private colleges in the country in 2014. Other notable universities in the top 20 include Vassar and Cornell in New York, Brown in Rhode Island, Middlebury in Vermont, Bucknell in Pennsylvania, and Reed in Oregon. College students living off-campus attending these and other universities often seek to rent a room near Ntheir schools rather than attempt to rent a place on their own. Fortunately, USA college rooms for rent are plentiful. And whether you’re going to school on the west coast, the east coast, down south, or anywhere in between, our roommate finder is a valuable and helpful tool in your housing search. Many millennials who have already graduated from college or are looking for internships or career opportunities outside of higher education find that apartment or house-sharing arrangements are an affordable way to live in desirable areas. The extensive number of “roommate wanted” offers in New York City is one example of this. The high cost of living in large, popular cities can be intimidating, but a room rental arrangement can put more money in your pocket and allow you to enjoy the amenities around you. You can easily find a roommate in San Francisco, Denver, Dallas, Philadelphia or any number of other large metropolises. Therefore, you will see an extremely large number of “roommates wanted” openings in huge cities. But even if you’re not a big-city type of person, you can still find excellent housing opportunities. Places like Dayton, Ohio, Pueblo, Colorado, Mesa, Arizona, and Union City, California have cheap rooms aplenty. You can successfully locate a roommate from Washington State to Washington, D.C. with a roommate finder. These home-sharing arrangements give you a great deal of flexibility and offer the opportunity to more easily live in a USA location of your choosing. EasyRoommate is an excellent solution for young people looking for roommates in the USA. Our Roommate finder will help you locate roommates, cheap rooms, and house shares in the city and state you’ve chosen.

I tried to find it using some housing websites but I faced the same problems again and again: tons of spam, fake advertisements... Then I found HousingAnywhere.com and everything turned friendly and easy: only real offers, safe payment methods, and people who were ready to help me. I finally found home thanks to them. Try it! Lulú Arias from Spain This platform was a lifesaver when I moved abroad, I was a bit skeptical about transferring money to a foreign bank account without having visited the apartment myself. The website's team assured that the money won't be transferred to the landlord until after I had moved in. Sure, I had to pay for it - but with that amount of money I wanted to lock down a house sooner rather than later; moreover, I wanted to be absolutely sure that my money wouldn't just disappear into thin air. All worked out like a charm! Mikko Kajander from the United States As a sales manager of 7 student residences with a strong reputation in France and especially in Clermont-Ferrand, this year we wanted to develop our offer abroad. Thanks to the Housing Anywhere platform, our accommodations have been advertised to students from all over the world and in one month time we had already very good feedback and quickly several bookings.
The communication with the team is fast and simple; this booking platform convinced me.

We don't rely on our subscribers as our only reviewers, waiting to see what trash they report after wading through it themselves.   We take out the trash FOR our subscribers.   We collect a lot of data, not just our actual questions, but also information from the submitter's computer and location which can only be accessed by site owners.

Unlike most ways you could find a roommate, we are paying attention to this information, and actually making use of it to decide which roommate profiles are worth accepting and which are probable scams.          SIDESTEP THE SCUMBAGS     In addition to weeding out roommate scammers, our human reviewers screen all new roommate profiles for other scumbags.   This is, pretty obviously, if you're well-intentioned, a ROOMMATE service.   Not a place to look for dates or confront any other "adult" content.   Anyone trying to sneak in something shady is way too sleazy for us, and we delete them.          AVOID TOTAL NITWITS     You can quickly determine which potential roommates are worth your time with our required questions, along with our Roommate Behavior Ratings.   We also delete anyone that sounds insincere, completely offbase, or just completely insane, BEFORE they'd see any current subscriber's profile.          KEEP IT FRESH     We require a valid email address to start roommate matching, then stay in touch, deleting those who say they no longer need to find a roommate.   We also check in every few weeks, requiring a response to remain active.   Other roommate services allow online-only profiles, or leave people up for multiple months, never bothering to check who still needs to find a roommate.   Our roommate profiles are as current as humanly possible, making it less likely you will waste your time trying to get in touch with anyone already finished roommate matching.          SAY NO TO SPAMBOTS     Spambots can't hack, crack, or otherwise scoop up your personal info, because we never publish it out on the open internet.          SAVE YOUR TIME     Do you want finding a roommate to be your new part-time job?   No?   You won't squander your free time via tedious database searching, endless bulletin-board browsing, or time-consuming site wading.   You don't have to surf our site endlessly to find new roommate matches; we'll just email you.   No extra busywork.          SPARE YOUR EMAIL ACCOUNT     You won’t end up subscribed to advertising for anything else - you’ll hear from us regarding your roommate search, not ever for any other reason.   Your information will not be shared, sold, or rented to anyone outside this roommate service.   Not even any “partner” offers or anything of that nature.   All information is only used for the purpose of roommate matching via this roommate service.   We are all about roommates.   Nothing else. Ever. Not even a little bit.          subscription options  Free for everyone to sign up and review roommate matches. No payment required unless we find a roommate you want to contact.           FREE Roommate Search  You sit back and wait for potential roommates to contact you.  Since anyone contacting you will have access to your Roommate Behavior Ratings, they should be good roommate matches.   However, the only subscribers that will be able to contact you will be Cheap Roommate Searchers (other Free Roommate Searchers won't have access to your contact info).   You stay in this category unless you choose Cheap Roommate Search.   You can switch to Cheap Roommate Search now, anytime in the future, or never.          CHEAP Roommate Search  You're in charge!  Your search will go faster and better, because you can contact the roommates YOU choose right away.  You'll get first crack at the best people, giving you an advantage over those who choose to review their matches first or those within Free Roommate Search.   You get the contact info for ALL your roommate matches, so you’re in charge of who to contact and when.   You can easily identify yourself when you contact those members who are still Free Roommate Searchers.   You pay 19.95, good for up to an ENTIRE YEAR.   There will never be any auto-rebilling or auto-recharging.   While most subscribers find a roommate more quickly, this means that if you upgrade, find a roommate, then for whatever reason need another within 12 months, you can be upgraded again for free.   Your match email will ALSO contain all YOUR answers to ALL the questions, along with the customized comparisons, making it very easy to contact whomever you like.  You just forward it along to your roommate choice as your detailed introduction, complete with pair compatibility already outlined.                          get started (find a roommate)        contact        faq - how our roommate service works             resources        add resource        link to us             all major metros served        upgrade from free roommate search to cheap roommate search             All rights reserved; all contents copyrighted © 1998- 2018                       #^$                  1. sign up    2. sign in    3. add your roommate advert    4. find a roommate                   fewer idiots.  no spam.  100% free.  let's do this       Previous Next      This roommate site is human-moderated.

What they're saying:          "I used to put ads in Newspapers for rooms for rent...this turned out to be a disaster. Locals with no jobs and trashy people were the only ones calling. I only used Roommates.com this time and ended up getting 2 great people for roommates. Very pleased!! I will always use this site in the future! Thanks a bunch! - Sally"    "This has been a wonderful tool for finding roommates! I have been fortunate enough to choose 2 roommates over the course of the last 2 months. Every canidate I met with off of roommates.com was a normal, down-to-earth person seriously looking for a new place to live. If you avidly pursue on roommates.com I am confident that you will find what you're looking for if you're a renter or a landlord. I will use this service again if I run into another empty room in the future!! Thank you. - Rayne"      "There is nothing bad I can say about this service, I feel it is above and beyond all other services I have tried. I get new matches emailed to me daily, which I love. Every time I sign on I see a new match, as opposed to other services, where I only see the same 3 people every time. When I emailed in a question about my account, I got a response within the hour, I really appreciate that! And the renovations you've done make it even better! Keep up the good work! - Emelye"    "This service has been great! I found the ideal roommates and the most incredible apartment through this service. I wish you existed years ago when I was looking. I paid about $200 last time registering with a bunch of roommate services and got absolutely no results. It too me months to find something. It only took me a week with your service. Thanks! - Susan"      "Wow! I'm a believer! Found your website accidentally...couldn't see myself paying $56.00 for an ad that would run only once! Decided to give the Internet a try and have been dumbfounded since! Congratulations...your website does work and was also impressed with the amount of professionals in your site! - Munsey"    "I think very highly of this website. I really liked the "room-mail" service. As a woman it made me feel more secure than giving out my email address to whoever wanted it. I had been searching for over a month before I signed up, and after I did I found my roommate in 2 days. Thank you so much. I will be referring my friends in the future. - Alice"      "Three cheers for Roommates.com! I found the most ideal roommate in less than ONE WEEK! I cannot thank you enough for saving me so much time and effort! I was concerned about displaying fliers in public places because I had no idea who would be calling and how safe it would be to interview potential roommates. Your website made me feel secure in my search! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!! I still can't believe how easy it all was! - Caroline"    "I just wanted to express my thanks to you guys for helping me find a "killer pad." I am moving back home and was going to spend loads of money to get my own apt. I chose to try Roommates.com, spent some time e-mailing prospects in respective filters that were easy to set up....MAN, WHAT A RESPONSE! I had a real choice on places, with pictures and everything...and I found a beautiful Italian Villa with a REALLY cool owner, the right price/deposit...and we have agreed on a deal! I am so excited to know that I have a place set up (that is beautiful) before I go out there and have to hotel it...spending twice as much whilst I look for a place and am busy working. Thank you sooooooo much! I owe so much to Roommates.com! - Jason"      "I was first signed up with a competitor of yours... however, I grew tired of writing to people I did not get responses from (couldn't tell how old the listings were) and was getting closer to D-Day when I decided to sign up for your service. I think the room-mail feature is great. It allows you to remain confidential until you're more comfortable and I loved the resources page you made available. I was able to use several of the links you provided. Of course, best of all...I found my new roommate and renter here! Thanks Much - Michelle"    "Thanks so much! We found an awesome roommate through your service. This website is very easy to use, I know because I've tried other roommate services on-line and I loved using this one. Everyday I had at least four new matches that were automatically chosen based on the details I gave you. Once again, thank you so much! I will definitely be recommending this site to anyone who is in need of a room or roommate. - Cristine"      "Thank you so much!! Your service helped me find a PERFECT roommate in less then a week (3 days to be exact)!!! My expectations were met and exceeded. Thank you again!!!!! - Maria"    "Roommates.com is the best referral service of its kind that I have ever used. It was quick and easy and extremely helpful. It was a lifesaver for me. I found the perfect place and I am very happy. I don't think I could've found it any other way. I don't know how people found roommates before roommates.com!!
