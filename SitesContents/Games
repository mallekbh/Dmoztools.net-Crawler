The plastic board has 100 holes, numbered in a oft reversing spiral with 1 in the center. A deck of numbered cards from 1-100 is shuffled and players start with 4 each. You may either play a card and stick a peg in, or draw a card, the hand limit being 4. And of course, you're trying to get five of your pegs in a row to win. Simple, except that playing a card allows you to place a peg in that number, or any empty number above. So with a 60, I can fill a space from 60 to 100, the outside rows effectively, but with a 6, I can play practically anywhere, especially the key points in the center area. The game is for 2-3 players, but works even better when played in partnership, your partner frustrated as you fill high numbers with low cards, you frustrated as your partner fails to block. Very good fun and nice for non-gamers.

Community Wiki     Edit       This game has been made by several game companies Milton Bradley put out the game of 99 in 1959, this one only had 60 cards with it 1-16 then only even cards to 96 then 97, 98,99,00. the 00 is wild and can be played on any number the object is the same as 5ive straight. Sometime later they changed it to be identical to 5ive straight.  Other makers that I know of are SKOR-MOR, SPL,and Stillmore Products.  Versions called "The Game of 99" were introduced by Broman/Percepta Corporation and Hartville Games in the early 1960's.

Warri, Oh-Wah-Ree) and more traditional Checkers-like games.  It is played by four players according to the original rules, but can be adpated to be played by just two (the three-player game would be unbalanced).  The 6x6 board is surrounded by Mancala-like pits, where pebbles are moved.  The number of pebbles in a row/column/diagonal's pits controls how the pawns on the board move.  Two sets of rules are supplied: the Alignment game, where you are trying to be the first to align four of your pawns in any six-space row --either horizontally, vertically or diagonally-- without opposing pawns between them, and the more advanced Capture game, where you're trying to capture your opponents' key pawns (kings, really).        + More    - Less           Official Links           Propose Official Link              Additional Suggestions     Language Dependence      No necessary in-game text               Show Community Stats        Community Stats        Own:   272     Wishlist:   27     For Trade:      17         Want In Trade:      16     Has Parts:   0     Wants Parts:   0         See All Stats     BGG Item ID: 2545           Buy a Copy           Stores            Suggested retail                   From  €9.90      Ebay listings (1)             GeekMarket - Recent         £5    a   Contigo  3M First Edition (1974)       €30    ln   Contigo  ()       $15    vg   Contigo  ()        See All (8)  Sell a Copy  Price History          Advertisement          Videos     Add         Hot Review        00:00    Contigo Game Review     review   nojoha · 2 years ago  ·   English        4   0            Hot "How To Play"    No video found.

Don't like your roll?  You get a second chance!  3 in a row scores one point.  Four in a row scores two points.  Get the point?  Build your rows or block your opponents.  There's fun and strategy on every roll, and doubles are always WILD!  The board is a grid, with the numbers 3-11 along each edge. Two blue dice determine which blue column, two red dice determine which red row, and you place your marble where they meet. Doubles are wild, so you can choose where to place your marble. If your opponent has a marble at that spot and it's not part of a three-in-a-row, you have a roll off, 3 dice and three chances, to see who can get the highest roll and claim that spot. Once a marble is part of a three-in-a-row it is locked in. Points are counted for a three-in-a-row in every direction; horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The game ends when someone runs out of marbles, and everyone has a final turn.  1999 Mensa Select        + More    - Less       Awards & Honors        1999 Mensa Select Winner        + More    - Less           Official Links           Propose Official Link              Additional Suggestions     Language Dependence      No necessary in-game text               Show Community Stats        Community Stats        Own:   119     Wishlist:   12     For Trade:      13         Want In Trade:      5     Has Parts:   0     Wants Parts:   0         See All Stats     BGG Item ID: 5120           Buy a Copy           Stores            Suggested retail                   From  $9.99      Ebay listings (1)             GeekMarket - Recent         $13    ln   Doubles Wild  ()       $13    vg   Doubles Wild  ()       €10    vg   Doubles Wild  ()        See All (3)  Sell a Copy  Price History          Advertisement          Videos     Add         Hot Review        12:15    Boards of Wood - Episode 001     review   Igloo cool · 4 years ago  ·   English        5   0            Hot "How To Play"    No video found.

      on the picture to look inside the box       Doubles Wild is a game of luck and strategy where the object is to make as many 3-in-a-rows
      as possible in any direction. Your roll determines where your marker may
      go. If you don't like your first roll, try again, rolling the blue dice,
      the red dice, or both. If you roll a double on red or blue, that's WILD,
      and you may place your marble anywhere in the row or column. If you land
      on your opponent's marble, you battle for control of the pocket. Play offense
      to make your own 3-in-a-rows, defense to block your opponent.  Doubles Wild takes just 5 minutes to
      learn.
      2-4 players, ages 8 to adult.  Doubles Wild is part of Enginuity's Signature Collection of solid wood and glass board games that look good enough to keep on display.

(January 2018)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )      Morabaraba    Morabaraba gameboard; pieces move from intersection to intersection along marked lines     Genre(s)  Board game , abstract strategy game    Players  2    Setup time  < 1 minute    Playing time  < 1 hour    Random chance  None    Skill(s) required  Strategy , tactics    Synonym(s)  Mlabalaba , mmela , muravava , umlabalaba, mororova    Morabaraba is a traditional two-player strategy  board game played in South Africa , Botswana and Lesotho . The game is known by many names in many languages, including mlabalaba , mmela (in Setswana), muravava , and umlabalaba . The game is similar to twelve men's morris, a variation on the Roman board game nine men's morris .  While some believe that morabaraba was introduced to southern Africa by British settlers, morris variants exist in many parts of the world; e.g. India ( char bhar ), Ghana ( achi ), Kenya ( shisimia ), Somalia ( shax ), Zimbabwe ( tsoro yemutwelve ), the Philippines ( tapatan ) and Mongolia ( gurgaldaj ). It is claimed that morabaraba boards carved in rock are dated to be at least 800 years old, which would exclude a European origin. However, many rock art images do not actually show morabaraba , but the mancala -type game of moruba (using rows of cupules).  Morabaraba is today most popular amongst rural African youth in southern Africa. In the traditional European games like nine men's morris, the counters are commonly referred to as "men", but in the South African game the counters are referred to as "cows", the game being particularly popular amongst youth who herd cattle.  According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the term morabaraba is derived from the Southern Sotho  moraba-raba , meaning 'to mill ' or 'to go round in a circle'.

While it may be played on specially produced boards (or simulated by computer software as a video game ), it is simple enough that a board can easily be scratched on a stone or into sand, with coins or pebbles (or whatever comes to hand) used as the pieces. The description below is compatible with Mind Sports South Africa 's "generally accepted rules".  There are three main phases to the game:   Placing the cows  Moving the cows  Flying the cows   Placing the cows [ edit ]   The board is empty when the game begins. Each player has 12 pieces, known as "cows"; one player has light cows and the other has dark cows  The player with the dark cows moves first  Each turn consists of placing a cow on an empty intersection on the board  The aim is to create a "mill": a row of three cows on any line drawn on the board  If a player forms a mill, he or she may remove or "shoot" one of the opponent's cows. The shot cow is removed from the board and not placed again. A cow in a mill may not be shot unless all of the opponent's cows are in mills, in which case any cow may be shot.  Even if a move creates more than one mill, only one cow can be shot in a single move   Moving the cows [ edit ]   After all the cows have been placed, each turn consists of moving a cow to an empty adjacent intersection  As before, completing a mill allows a player to shoot one of the opponent's cows. Again, this must be a cow which is not in a mill, unless all of the opponent's cows are in mills.  Players are allowed to "break" their own mills  A mill may be broken and remade repeatedly by shuffling cows back and forth. Each time the mill is remade, one of the opponent's cows is shot. Of course, by breaking the mill the player exposes the cows which were in a mill to the risk of being shot by the opponent on his or her next turn.  In the "generally accepted rules" published by Mind Sports South Africa, a mill which is broken to form a new mill can not be formed again on the next move   Flying the cows [ edit ]   When a player has only three cows remaining, desperate measures are called for. This player's cows are allowed to "fly" to any empty intersection, not just adjacent ones.  If one player has three cows and the other player has more than three cows, only the player with three cows is allowed to fly   Finishing the game [ edit ]   A win occurs if one opponent has no moves  A win occurs if a player has just two cows  If either player has only three cows and neither player shoots a cow within ten moves, the game is drawn  If one person cheats, then the other one wins by default   Morabaraba as sport [ edit ]  Currently the International Wargames Federation is the international governing body for the game as a competitive sport, and Mind Sports South Africa (MSSA) is the South African governing body. MSSA is recognised by both the South African Department of Sports and Recreation and the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC) .  MSSA has developed amateur leagues, using different regional versions of the game, throughout the country, and has adopted a notation scoring system similar to that for nine men's morris.  The game is an official discipline of the Traditional World Games, which are held every five years. Tournaments were not just in South Africa, but also in Bangkok (Thailand), Melbourne (Australia), New Orleans (United States), Athens (Greece), and at the Epsom College in England.  World Championships [ edit ]  Since 1997, Morabaraba World Championships have been held, in three divisions: senior (i.e. adult males), women, and junior (boys and girls). Divisional winners are shown in the table below.

It differs from the standard form in that the board does not have diagonals between the center points of its sides and there is an additional intersection in the center of the board to prevent a draw.  Eleven men's morris [ edit ]  This is a European variation that uses the same board as morabaraba but is played with eleven counters. This prevents a situation where the game can end in a draw in the placement phase.  Standard notation [ edit ]  The standard Welt-Mühlespiel-Dachverband notation for nine men's morris works well for morabaraba  (see diagram) . It is very similar to algebraic notation in chess . The board is laid out on a grid, with the columns in the grid being labelled a–g (from left to right), and rows in the grid being labelled from 1–7 (bottom to top). Each point is then referred to by its coordinate; for example, the top-left point in the middle (not inner) square is labelled b6. Moves are then formatted as in chess or draughts: placing a piece is denoted simply by the square where it is placed; moving a piece by the from and to squares (e.g. c5-d5); capturing by appending the captured piece to the move (e.g. c5-b6xe5 or c4xa1).

      Games  About            This game, with an ancestry so old it is another contender for the 
            prize of 'Oldest game in the world', is known by a number of different 
            names in England - Nine Mens Morris or Morelles or or Merrills or 
            Merels or Mill or just plain Morris. The picture shows a pocket game of Mill from the author's collection.      Three Mens Morris History  There seem to be two forms of the ancient game of Three Mens Morris; 
        one with diagonals and one without. The diagonals form is effectively 
        the same game as Tic-Tac-Toe or Noughts and Crosses today and a board 
        of this type has been found cut into the temple at Kurna, Egypt (~1440 
        BC) although this may well have been done at some later time.  According to Thomas Hyde (1908), the Chinese also played the game c. 
        500BC.  A couple of centuries on, Ovid mentions the game in "Ars Amatoria". 
        Roman boards were usually made of wood or tone although the rich occasionally 
        had boards made of more exotic materials (Trimalchio had one of turpentine-tree 
        and Martial speaks of an ivory board).  The game was widely played in England in AD1300 and visitors to the cathedrals 
        of Norwich, Canterbury, Gloucester, Salisbury and Westminster Abbey can 
        see boards cut into the cloister seats by monks.    Nine Mens Morris History  Presumably an extension of the simpler Three Mens Morris, a Nine Mens 
        Morris pattern is another of the boards that have been cut into the temple 
        at Kurna, Egypt (~1440 BC). Other boards have been found in Ceylon which 
        were carved during the reign of Mahadithika Maha-Naga (9-21AD). European 
        boards have been found in such places as the first city of Troy, within 
        a Bronze age burial site in Ireland and at the Acropolis in Athens. The 
        game reached its peak popularity in Europe during the Fourteenth Century.      In Germany, the game is called Muhle and in central Europe generally, 
              the board is sometimes stepped. This example was bought by the author 
              in Switzerland.      As an old English game, it used to be played with black and white pebbles 
        on a board marked out with a trowel dug into village greens as well as 
        in Taverns on boards marked with chalk on a table. Shakespeare mentioned 
        it in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" Act 2, Scene 1 - "The 
        Nine Mens Morris is filled up with mud" which is what must have happened 
        to the boards marked in the village green when it rained!    Morabaraba  There 
        is a version of Nine Mens Morris known as Morabaraba or Umlabalaba, which 
      is still popular and played to competitive level in Botswana and South Africa.  It is 
        played on a board with diagonals but the rules are virtually identical to Nine Mens Morris aside from that.      Where to Buy  Masters

Equipment | Object | Gameplay | Strategy | Variations    Equipment   The board consists of three nested squares connected by a line through each of
the four sides. Pieces are placed at the corners of the squares and the
intersections on the sides.  Nine pieces are needed for each player, for a
total of eighteen pieces. Beads, coins, checkers, and colored glass "stones"
all work well.   Print out a board:    PostScript (4 KB)  PDF (6 KB)    Object  The key concept of the game is the mill : a straight line of three pieces
of the same color along a line on the board.  When a player forms a mill, that
player can remove any one of their opponent's pieces that is not also part of a
mill.  If all of the opponent's pieces are in mills, then any piece may be
removed.  There are two ways to win Nine Mens Morris: Reduce the number of your
opponent's pieces to two, or block all of your opponent's pieces so they cannot
move.   Gameplay  The game begins with an empty board. Randomly select a player to go first.
Gameplay proceeds in three phases. If a player forms a mill during any of the
phases, that player immediately removes one piece belonging to their opponent.  In the opening phase, the players alternate placing pieces on the board.  Once
all pieces have been placed, then the players alternate moving one of their
pieces into an adjacent, unoccupied space. Pieces must move along a line on the
board, and may never jump another piece. The ending phase begins when one
player has been reduced to only three pieces. At that point, the player with
three pieces may jump a piece to any position on the board.  The game ends when the the winner reduces his opponent to two pieces (thus can
no longer form mills), or blocks all of his opponents pieces from movement.   Strategy   There are three types of spaces on the board: corners, sides, and
intersections . Mobility is key in Nine Mens Morris--a single piece trapped
by opposing pieces is useless.  Therefore, corners are weak since they only
have two adjacent spaces (it's easy to get a piece trapped in a corner). Sides
are stronger than corners, but weaker than intersections, since they have three
adjacent spaces. Intersections are the strongest positions on the board since
they have four adjacent spaces.   Opening Strategy  The first player enjoys a slight advantage: he can always claim two
intersections.  If the second player isn't careful, a strong first player has a
good chance of claiming three of the four intersections.  The second player
(red) should not be too hasty in claiming the last intersection, if the board
looks like this:   If the red player takes the last intersection, then the blue player will lay a
common trap by playing in the corner between his two intersections, creating
two potential mills.  Since the red player can only block one of them, the blue
player will succeed in getting a mill and red will lose a piece!  Be very careful not to lose any pieces in the opening phase!  Being even one
piece short can be disasterous at the start of the second phase.  In the opening phase of the game, it is often better to attempt to separate the
opponent's pieces from each other and block them from moving than to form
mills.  But be warned: a crowded board with few free pieces is very delicate.
One wrong move can easily shift the advantage to your opponent.  It is not good to continually force your opponent to block you from creating
mills in the opening phase.  This will likely lead to all of your pieces being
blocked and puts you in a weak position for the midgame.  Common Formations   In this diagram, blue has a very powerful arrangement of pieces called a double mill .  It allows a player to complete a mill on every turn by
moving one piece back and forth between two positions.  It is very difficult to counter a double mill. Ideally, a player could form a
mill of their own and remove a piece from the double mill.  However, it is hard
to form a mill when you are losing pieces every turn.  Another alternative is
to try and block the piece from moving back and forth, but it is also unlikely
that the double mill player will let you get away with it.  Sometimes it is
possible to threaten to form a mill that requires your opponent to break up his
double mill to block.  Of course, the best defense against a double mill is to
keep your eye out for them and never let your opponent form one in the first
place.   Variations  Five Men's Morris   A smaller, quicker game than Nine Mens Morris, this game uses only two
	rings of the Morris board.  Each player has five pieces, and gameplay
	works exactly like Nine Mens Morris.  Note that on this board, a mill can only be formed along the sides,
	not radiating out from the middle like on the larger board.   Eleven Men's Morris   Uses a board with three concentric squares, but with lines connecting
	the corners, allowing mills to be formed diagonally.  Each player has
	eleven pieces, and gameplay works exactly like Nine Mens Morris.   Twelve Men's Morris  Uses the same board as Eleven Mens Morris, but each player has twelve
	pieces.  There are twenty-four positions on the board, so if both
	players play a perfect opening phase (no mills were formed), the game
	will end in a draw.  Copyright © 2005 by Randy Cox      #^$     #^$  Set Quarto  This game plays the same as the commercially-available game
Quarto, except that you can do it with SET® cards.  This fact
was discovered by Greg Morrison. Uwe Wilhelm brought the game to our attention after he found a
posting in rec.games.board, or maybe rec.games.abstract.  Not owning
Quarto ourselves, we've paraphrased that posting's description for
SET® cards, plagiarizing liberally at times. Requirements  Part of a deck of SET® cards.  In particular, choose all the cards
that have only two of the three values of each property.  E.g., remove
all cards with threes, opens, purples, or diamonds.  You'll be left
with 16 cards, which is the deck for this game. Setup  Lay out 16 of the unused cards face down in a 4x4 grid.  These
cards are merely placeholders marking the playing surface.  Lay out
the 16 cards in the deck face up. How To Play  Players take turns placing one card each on one of these 16
spaces.  The twist is that a player has to place the card that his
opponent gives him. The game begins when one player gives a card of his choice to the
other.  The second player places that card anywhere on the board, then
chooses another card to give to the first player.  The first player
places that card, chooses another to give to the second player, and so
on. How To Win  The goal is to place four cards, all with a common attribute,
either in a line of four or together forming a 2x2 square anywhere on
the board.  ( NOTE :  I think I recall that the Quarto rules call
only for having 4 cards in a line; the 2x2-square version is mentioned
as an alternative.) It is possible for a game to end in a draw, at least in the simple,
line-of-4-only version.  It happened to us, once, like this .  We don't know if it's
possible to end in a draw using the 2x2-square variant, or any of the
variants below. Comments  The difficulty in the game lies in the fact that there are so many
attributes to keep track of that it makes your head spin.  The game
ends up having two part turns -- deciding where to play the card
given to you, then deciding what piece to give to your opponent.  The
game is short but it requires a lot of concentration. Variants, part 1  It can be interesting to play with different rules for what
combinations of four positions are "wins" (i.e., different than the
usual rows, columns, diagonals, and 2x2 squares).  On the regular 4x4
grid here are some possibilities for additional "wins" to use:   Other squares :  Use the corners of any other squares you
can find, besides the 2x2 ones.  (Unless I'm miscounting), there are
six 3x3 squares, one 4x4 square, four 1x1 "slanty" squares, and two
"knight's move" squares.  Here are examples of each of these types of
squares:  - X - X    X - - X    - X - -    - X - -
- - - -    - - - -    X - X -    - - - X
- X - X    - - - -    - X - -    X - - -
- - - -    X - - X    - - - -    - - X -    Wraparound diagonals :  There are six of these in all.
Three of them are shown here; the other three are mirror images of
these.  - X - -    - - X -    - - - X

Three of them are shown here.  Three others are similar.  The seventh
is the one with X's in the four corners, which is mentioned in a
different guise above under "Other squares".  X X - -   - X X -   X - - X
- - - -   - - - -   X - - X
- - - -   - - - -   - - - -
X X - -   - X X -   - - - -    Another possibility is to try entirely different topological
arrangements for the playing surface, instead of the standard 4x4
grid.  This can lead to some very different relationships between the
available positions.  One arrangement that we have tried is the
"starburst" pattern:  |
                   \   |   /
                     \   /
                 -  -     -  -
                     /   \
                   /   |   \
                       |   With this arrangement we used the following "winning positions".
It is relatively easy to see others that might be used.   Rows - four cards in a row (4 total)  Inner half-circles - four consecutive cards in an arc of 
the inner ring (8 total)  Outer half-circles - same, except outer ring (8 total)  Wedges - two adjacent "half-rows" (8 total)  Variants, part 1  A completely different type of variant was suggested by Chris
Jachimowicz:  Instead of using cards to mark the territory of the
board, allow the placement of the cards to dictate it.  So the first
card played might become either a corner piece or an inside piece as
dictated by the placement of the following cards.  Likewise, until
more cards are placed, you won't be sure that the first card played is
an outside row/column, or an inside piece.   mag and judd  #^$ Bill's Pente Program   About the program This is a unix program that plays the game of Pente.  You can play against
the computer, against another person sitting next to you, or against
somebody on another computer across the internet! It has a good X11 GUI interface, but it will run with a curses
interface if you don't have X windows.  For the truly primitive Pente player, 
you can run it in pure text mode.  Yes, you can even play on your
1970s-era teletype if you really want to. Pente has multi-language support, and currently can be used in French,
English, or Italian.  If you speak another language fluently and are willing to
translate the text in the program, please get in touch with me. Downloading Pente  Pente is distributed in source code.  It uses the Gnu autoconfig
system and should be portable across all Unix/X11R4 or later systems. This link is to a binary object.  You probably don't want to download it

Amazons  by Argentinian Walter Zamkauskas  Introduction  Eli Bachmutsky sent us this description of the game Amazons. It was posted on 
the newsgroup rec.games.abstract on 16 Dec 1994, by Ed Pegg Jr ((email removed contact us for address) com.com).
The rules have been published in World Game Review and Games . History  El Juego de las Amazonas was invented in 1988 by Walter Zamkauskas of Argentina, 
and first published (in Spanish) in issue number 4 of the puzzle magazine El Acertijo  
in December of 1992.   The game was informally introduced to the postal gaming club 
The Knights of the Square Table by Michael Keller in 1993, where it gained immediate 
popularity.  An authorized translation by Mr. Keller was published in January 1994 
in World Game Review.     The first international match was a friendly team match, 
played by fax between Argentina and the United States in 1994-1995; the six games 
were split 3-3. A team postal match between Italy and the United States is in progress. El Juego de las Amazonas (The Game of the Amazons) is a trademark of 
Ediciones de Mente.   For more information, contact : Jaime Poniachik, 
Publicaciones Aperiodicas, Casilla de Correo 74, Sucursal 12, 1412 Buenos Aires, 
Argentina (fax. 054-1-962-8343). See also:  Michael Keller's pages on this game
and a computer program for it . (Link.)  Equipment  4 red tokens, 4 blue tokens, 92 black Go stones, and a 10x10 board. Rules   Red has amazons on A4/D1/G1/J4, Blue has amazons on A7/D10/G10/J7.  Red starts, and turns alternate.  On each turn, a player's amazon 
moves like a chess queen, then 'fires an arrow' a queen's move from its 
stopping square; both parts of the move are MANDATORY.  Use the go stones 
to mark the arrows.  Amazon and arrow cannot move over or onto an occupied square.  The 
arrow's landing place becomes a permanent block to all arrows and amazons.  Last player able to finish a turn wins.   Email me if you're interested in playing a game.  :) Sample Games-in-progress  Here are two sample games-in-progress: A:     1.      g1g9/d9         d10i5/i4

Visual Basic 3.0 for Windows by Michael Keller in April and May of 1995.
The program also
requires vbrun300.dll (available at most shareware sites), Windows 3.1 (not tested under
3.0), a Windows-compatible mouse, and VGA graphics.     
The program is provided as is, 
and no guarantees as to its performance are given.

View  Kevin Pacey wrote on 2018-02-27 CET Excellent ★★★★★ This game reminds me of an old chessboard puzzle involving the placing of a number of queens, to solve a certain task, but of course Amazons is something even more complex, in that it is a full-fledged game. It also seems almost simple at first sight, deceptively so.   View  Alfred Pfeiffer wrote on 2008-11-03 CET You find a download for an Amazons.zrf by Jens Markmann at the end of

The rules
    of Amazons are below. The " challenge " and " move " commands are described here. Other
    commands are the same for all pbmserv games.  Amazons Command Summary   amazons challenge userid1  userid2 [ userid3 ] [ userid4 ] or amazons challenge [ -setup | -free ] userid1  userid2 [ userid3 [ userid4 ] ]   Start a new game between userid1 and userid2 (and userid3 and userid4 for 3 or 4 player games). The -free option is for 3 and 4 player games. Normally when a player
        cannot move, he is out of the game. With the -free option, if a player gets the
        opportunity to move again (which can only occur if another player moves out of the way),
        he is allowed back into the game.  The -setup option causes the game to use alternate
        beginning setups for 3 and 4 player games. Use "amazons preview new [34] -setup"
        to see them.  These are the possible opening setups for Amazons boards.   Two Player Game a b c d e f g h i j

        labeled a-j from left to right, and ranks (horizontal rows) labeled 1-10 from top to
        bottom.  <from>, <to>, and <arrow> are file and
        rank coordinates. Nearly any non-alphanumeric character may be used as a separator.  <from> is the starting square of the amazon. <to> is the stopping square of the amazon. <arrow> is the square where the arrow lands.  Here is an example move. Ohs plays "g1-b6,b7"
        from the opening setup.   a b c d e f g h i j              a b c d e f g h i j

       a b c d e f g h i j              a b c d e f g h i j    Rules of Amazons Amazons is played on
    a 10x10 board.  Each player has 4 pieces. Player one (Ohs) has amazons on a4, d1, g1, and j4. Player two (Eks) has amazons on a7, d10, g10, and j7.  Ohs moves first, and turns alternate. Each turn consists of
    two parts, and both parts are mandatory.  The player first moves one of his amazons. Amazons move as a
        chess queen (any number of spaces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). Amazons may
        not jump over or land on other pieces or arrows.  Next, the amazon which just moved "fires an arrow"
        from its new location. Arrows can be show in any direction, the same as a chess queen, and
        may not jump over or land on other pieces or arrows.   Once an arrow lands, it acts as an immovable barrier to all
    arrows and amazons.  The last player able to finish a turn wins the game.  Strategy Hint:   Since play continues until one player has no moves left for
    his Amazons, the basic strategy is to block your opponent into a small area surrounded by
    arrows. Since the Amazon must shoot an arrow each time it moves, it will soon run out of
    moves.  Another strategy is to block one of your own Amazons into a
    large area, while the others fight over the remaining territory with your opponent. If you
    don't move that Amazon, the area becomes a reserve of free moves which can be used at the
    end of the game, when the rest of the board fills up.             #^$     ×          ×                      365Chess.com  Chess Games Database Online      Username    Password          Forgot your password?

comments                        Thursday, September 7, 2017     Penang is 4th in Asian Cities    The Penang team did very well to finish in 4th position in the Asian Cities Team Championship in India just last month.  Their final score of 5 wins 2 draws and 2 losses puts them just behind Dhaka, thus missing a podium finish. The team was in third position after seven rounds. A round eight loss to final third placed Dhaka, denied them the bronze medal.     The team performance is commendable especially as several members of the team won board prizes. They are  Board 1 (Silver) for Looi Xin Hao  Board 2 (Bronze) for Wong Yinn Loong  Board 4 (Bronze) for Tan Jun Ying     Photo from FIDE website       Posted by Jimmy Liew   at 9:41 AM    0
comments                        Saturday, August 5, 2017     Middlegame Strategy    I remember starting out in chess a long time ago. I had no opening and I was primarily a tactical player. I had no problem as long as there were some tactical possibilities in the middlegame. I got better and started studying openings and my results improved. Then I noticed something, there were some players that I always had difficulties with. I could never get the type of positions I liked with them.  I knew something was missing from my game.

Then I found Ludek Pachman's books called "Modern Chess Strategy" which is a three volume set and I found the gap in my chess understanding. These books took a lot of effort to understand but it helped me to increase my playing strength.  The link between openings and middlegame - the former determines the latter's pawn structure. By studying the games of masters based on this structures, you will come to a better grasp of how to play these type of structures which occur again and again even from different openings.  The basic middlegame structures can be grouped as follows  1. Isolated Queen Pawn aka IQP 2. Hanging Pawns 3. Doubled pawns 4. Caro-kann formation 5. Slav formation 6. Carlsbad center 7. Stonewall center 8. Closed King's Indian 9. Open King's Indian 10. Grunfeld center 11. French center 12. Benoni Center 13. Benko formation 14. Sicilian Centers 15. Miscellaneous others  So one way of studying the middlegame is to take positions from the above and thoroughly understand how to play them. For this purpose, I am starting a series of classes on Middlegame Strategy. There will be 4-5 sessions cost at RM50 per session. The first session will be on Sunday 20th August 2017.

One of Houdini's two wins came in the revenge game for a 3...Be7 Tarrasch French, so one can blame that on the opening, and the other win was a 95-move win on the white side of a Dutch...so you can also blame that one on the opening. (No doubt the Stockfish programmers have been hard at work figuring out how they didn't manage to win their white game against the Dutch.)  Those were Houdini's high points, all two of them. Stockfish won 20 games, 13 with White and an impressive 7 with Black. (My two favorites were games 31, its white win in the 3...Be7 Tarrasch French; and game 81, which bore a little resemblance to the sorts of games it lost to Alpha Zero a few months back.) There were many other games where Stockfish had the upper hand, and it wasn't clear whether Houdini would manage to save them. So as convincing as the victory was, it could have been even worse.  Congratulations to the Stockfish team, and I hope Houdini's programmer Robert Houdart doesn't wait a year or two to make improvements, but springs back into action as soon as real life permits. (Likewise, I hope the Komodo team makes some big improvements as well.) Stockfish is doing great, but if they don't feel any pressure they might slacken the pace.  TCEC home page .

The match, held this past Sunday in San Francisco, finished in an 8-8 tie, so it was on to overtime. The way that worked is like this: the fourth boards would play, with the winner going on to play the third board. In case of a draw, both players get eliminated, and the next board up for each side would play. (Unless, obviously, it's a draw on first board. In that case, they play again with colors reversed.) The Chinese fourth board won, but then lost to Armenia's third board. Then the third boards drew and eliminated each other; likewise the second boards. Then the first boards drew their first game and the second one too, before at long last Zaven Andriasian defeated Wang Yue to give the outrated Armenias the title.

This is his third tournament victory in his last four events (he also won the London Chess Classic and the Candidates), and he's back to #2 in the world, ahead of Shakhriyar Mamedyarov and 21 points behind Magnus Carlsen. Not bad at all!  After six of the tournament's nine rounds he was tied for first with Maxime Vachier-Lagrave and Nikita Vitiugov, with Carlsen half a point behind. In round 7 Carlsen beat Arkadij Naiditsch with Black, but at the same time Caruana defeated MVL - also with Black - to go into clear first, with Vitiugov and Carlsen half a point behind. All the other games in round 7 were drawn, and in round 8 everyone drew.  That set up an exciting last round, with Caruana playing Black against Vitiugov and Carlsen having Black against Viswanathan Anand. The latter game was an interesting and mutually well-played draw, while Caruana's game echoed his Candidates finale against Alexander Grischuk. Once again he was paired with a Russian, had Black, played the Petroff, and faced the slightly unusual line 3.d4 Nxe4 4.dxe5 d5 5.Nbd2. And once again, he outplayed his opponent and won.  Congratulations once again to Caruana, who now comes back to St. Louis to try to reclaim the U.S. Championship title he won in 2016 but surrendered to Wesley So in 2017. As usual, the big three are all participating in the tournament, which begins April 18. Also starting on the 18th is the Gashimov Memorial in Shamkir, and Carlsen will be in that event, along with Mamedyarov, Vladimir Kramnik, and six other top players.  Back to the GCC. The games from the last three rounds, with my notes to the three decisive games, are here . (N.B. I've analyzed the Vitiugov-Caruana game more deeply for ChessLecture.com, for those of you who have memberships there, are considering memberships, or want to watch it a la carte when it comes out.) And here are the final standings:    1. Caruana 6.5 (of 9)  2. Carlsen 5.5  3-5. Aronian, Vitiugov, Vachier-Lagrave 5  6. Bluebaum 4.5  7-9. Anand, Hou Yifan, Naiditsch 3.5  10.

And then it slowed down: there were six draws, then two more Stockfish wins, and since then there have been 16 draws in a row.

Round 4 was already covered in the preceding post; now we'll have a look at rounds 5 and 6.  In round 5, all five games were drawn, including those featuring the leaders. There were two games, not featuring the leaders, which could and should have finished with a winner. Georg Meier was beating Magnus Carlsen after the world champion was enticed by a dubious tactical trick (30...Qf5 31.Rf1 Ba6). Fortunately for Carlsen, White's wins weren't entirely obvious, and as they arose on move 39, right before the time control, Meier may not have had the time and peace he needed to spot the subtle points within the winning variations.  That was a fortunate escape for Carlsen, but not nearly as lucky as Matthias Bluebaum's save against Arkadij Naiditsch. Bluebaum's 19...Bxd3 was a terrible move, giving his opponent a crushing attack for an irrelevant pawn. Fortunately for Bluebaum, Naiditsch went for the flashy 23.Rxg7, sacrificing a rook, when the boring 23.f4 would have won quickly and at no cost. White was still winning even after giving away a rook, but further errors and inaccuracies resulted in an ending where the win was no longer easy, and in fact the game soon petered out into equality.  With all five games drawn, the status quo was maintained. In round 6 there were a pair of decisive games, but neither affected the top of the crosstable, and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Nikita Vitiugov, and Fabiano Caruana remain in clear first with +2 scores. Vitiugov played Vachier-Lagrave, enjoying a slight-to-moderate advantage throughout in a game that was played to bare kings. Caruana, however, was in grave danger, worse and at times losing on the White side of a Petroff(!) against Hou Yifan(!). Apparently Caruana's favorite black opening against 1.e4 is so strong that he doesn't know what to do against it either. He had to suffer for a very long time to save the game, but since tomorrow's a rest day he'll have a chance to recover before round 7.  Turning to the decisive games, Meier stood well against Naiditsch in a very sharp game, but fell asleep (not literally) on move 33. White had a number of reasonable options, and they all had in common that they enabled him to defend against threats on the a8-h1 diagonal. Instead, Meier played 33.cxb6, completely missing Black's idea. After 33...Qb7, it was already time for White to resign, and he did.  The other decisive game was a big upset, with bottom-seed Bluebaum beating former world champion Viswanathan Anand. Anand equalized with Black out of the opening, but still needed to be a little careful about his a- and b-pawns. I've seen Anand use little tactics to "kill" a position (i.e. make it a dead draw) on countless occasions, but this time he miscalculated and lost material. He tried sacrificing a piece for a couple of pawns, one a far-advanced passer, but it wasn't enough. The youngster (Bluebaum will turn 21 in a week and a half) won and made it back to 50%.  The games of the last two rounds are here (with some annotations by me). Tomorrow (Saturday) is a rest day, and on Sunday the pairings for round 7 are as follows:    Naiditsch (2.5) - Carlsen (3.5)  Anand (2) - Meier (1.5)  Hou Yifan (2) - Bluebaum (3)  Vachier-Lagrave (4) - Caruana (4)  Aronian (3.5) - Vitiugov (4)         Dennis Monokroussos |  4 Comments |  Share Article   tagged  2018 Grenke Chess Classic           Page  1  2  3  4  5  ...  429   Next 10 Entries »        Copyright © 2017, Dennis Monokroussos.

The first and one of the most important is, are you going to be playing chess with it?  This sounds like a crazy question, but believe it or not, knowing whether your new set is for decoration or actual play is important. The reason is because most people find it difficult to play chess when they’re trying to constantly determine which piece is which. For instance, with some of the theme chess sets, (where the pieces might look like Disney or Star Wars characters) you may find that you may have to ask more than once which piece is the king and which is the queen because they look so much alike. Or maybe the pawns are almost the same size as the bishops, making them hard to differentiate. If so, it makes it hard to stay focused on a plan of attack when part of your attention is used to determine which of the chess pieces are which.  If you’re looking for a chess set for decoration, the sky’s the limit when it comes to theme and cost. You can literally get any design and pay any amount depending on the rarity of the chess board and chess pieces as well as the materials used to make them.  If on the other hand, you’re looking for a chess set to play on, then there is only one type of chess set design to buy and that’s Staunton.  Staunton pieces  However, before I bought a Staunton chess set for play, I would ask myself, is it for the home to be used when friends come over or will I be going to chess tournaments and competing with it?  Again, with regard to price, the sky’s the limit for the same reasons previously mentioned. If you want to have a chess set around the house to play with against friends and visitors, you may want to get a nice wooden chess board and some really nice chess pieces. You could pay almost any amount for  Staunton chess sets and chess boards, again determined by the size of the chess pieces and board, what they’re made out of and how intricate the design is.  One thought to keep in mind that can be an issue when buying chess pieces separately from the chess board is making sure the pieces fit properly on the chessboard. If the chess pieces are too big for the squares, it makes playing the game very difficult. Obviously, a chess piece is too big if the base of the chess piece is bigger than the square on the board. However, chess pieces are also too big for a given chess board if the base of the chess piece even takes up much of the entire square on the board.  If you decide you want a chess set for play in competition, then buying expensive chess pieces and a wooden chess board is probably not going to be the best move. Most everyone who plays in chess tournaments has either plastic or inexpensive wooden chess pieces along with roll-up vinyl boards.  Roll up vinyl board  The vinyl chess boards work great because they are easy to pack up for travel. One last thought on roll-up boards. They’re called roll-up boards for a reason, don’t fold them! If you do, they will never lay flat and that’s another possible distraction because the pieces are tilting and looking as if they are going to fall over. Also, roll your vinyl chess boards backwards with the squares on the outside so when you unroll them, they will lay flat.  Throw in a nice chess bag to hold all of your chess pieces and chess board and you’re almost ready to play in your first tournament.  Chess bag with vinyl roll up board  All you need now is the right chess clock. You have basically two choices here, analog or digital. Analog chess clocks have been around a long time. They have two hands like a regular clock and a small flag that drops or falls when someone runs out of time.  Digital clocks have much more versatility than analog chess clocks. They allow you to play all types of time frames including increment (where time is added on every move) and delay, where time runs for a period of time (usually 5 seconds or so) before the actual tournament time begins to run. It would be unusual to see increment play at a tournament, however delay is seen, especially at local clubs.  Analog chess clock  Digital chess clock                    If you’re thinking chess gifts for the chess player in your family, then the right chess pieces, chess boards and chess clocks are great ideas whether it’s for a birthday or the holiday season.

With plenty of fighting chess, us, the fans, got a daily share of entertainment that is hard to compare to anything we can remember.

The tournament was interesting overall and every player showed great fighting spirit and determination.

There are many forced lines that both sides usually need to know by heart and it’s not unusual to see black’s king left in the center. In most of the lines, both sides are eyeing the enemy king and tactical blows are very common.

This ability allows a chess player to calculate tactics precisely multiple moves ahead and most importantly it makes it possible to picture and evaluate the final position correctly. This is exactly what Magnus Carlsen was referring to when he was asked how many moves ahead he can calculate. Carlsen replied that the trick is to evaluate the final position, not simply to calculate the moves .

The training of the mind is not as easily measured as the physical training, for example. While running, lifting weights or swimming will transform you and you will see results in a short amount of time after doing it, it is not that simple with chess.

It is a pretty rare opening which may either be used a surprise or a weapon of choice. White challenges the black center right away and ends up with an aggressive looking position. Black has his own pluses, including the exposed white's queen in the center of the board and possibility of a rapid development.

The games are typically theoretically tense, and those with better opening preparation tend to succeed. Let's take a look at some of the best classical games played on Scotch.

Wesley So Teaches Chess    GM  Gserper  4 days ago   In an old article, I expressed the opinion that some games played by really strong grandmasters shouldn't be studied by inexperienced players. Therefore I suggested to assign chess games ratings similar to movies. The article claimed that according to this classification, "Magnus Carlsen's games are definitely NC-17 and not suitable for players rated under 1500." 
Naturally, I got a question in the comments about which chess player's games are suitable for less experienced players. Thank...

Nakamura Proteges To Compete In Europe    FM  MikeKlein  2 days ago   If you win a game in a simul, sometimes your prize is an autograph. Or a book. Maybe even a picture with the master. One lucky South African won a summer chess tour of Europe.
Although not officially a prize, CM Khanya Mazibuko's victory against GM Hikaru Nakamura in a 101-board simul in January impressed the world-class GM. Nakamura decided he'd give back by announcing at the end of the South African Junior Chess Championship that he'd like to sponsor the 16-year-old. 
Nakamura...       Frank Marshall, Part 4: St. Petersburg 1914 And The Gods Of Chess    IM  Silman  5 days ago   In part 3 we left Frank Marshall playing in one tournament or match after another. Nothing changed in 1912. The guy seemed to live for chess and he continued to compete all over Europe, Russia, and the U.S. Since he couldn’t fly to all those places, one wonders how much of his time was taken on ships and trains. 
Personally, I would be exhausted since once you get to where you want to be, you have to play in a tournament for a couple weeks or a month or even longer. Then, when it’s...

First, it is not every day you mingle with such legends as Anatoly Karpov.
Also, the way we entered the stage was quite remarkable.

chess GUI)    Ed's "Chess Art"                Probably the best of the "personal homepage"
style chess sites on the web, this one has actual content; tidbits,
opinions, essays, problems, etc. Especially useful for those new to
online chess, Ed has a section comparing the various chess servers, and
a page devoted to the WinBoard interface.   The above
description of this page was written by the author of the wonderful chess site  Chessopolis .   Thanks!   I
stumbled onto your outstanding chess page while doing a net search for
chess-related topics. Your page combines lots of useful info with your
sparkling wit. I've owned my PC since last April and have never enjoyed
a page as much as I did yours. And thanks for the link to FICS.
Somebody at work said that they played chess at Yahoo! and I wondered
how good their site could be. Having read your critique , my suspicions were confirmed.  The above
comments were recently e-mailed to me from  Tom Duda.  Thanks Tom!!             I've
seen a lot of great websites out there, but yours is the first one that
has moved me to write this kind of message of appreciation. I think
it's tremendously well done and obviously a labor of love.  I'm fond of chess --
started playing at around 10 but never very seriously. I'm now 76 and
think that I played better when I was 10, but that's besides the point.
Your site has encouraged me to get back to devoting a little time to
the game.  Many thanks.  The above
comments come from Robert Safier. Whoa! Thanks for the kind words!                A
position from one of my over-the-board tournament games recently appeared in the Los Angeles Times !  Click here to see the details!    Several
years ago, when I lived in Mesa, Arizona, a picture of me playing chess was published in the Wednesday, April 6, 1994 edition of the  Arizona Republic .  Click here to see the scanned image.               This chess page of mine was the  Link

handle on
		FICS, the Free Internet Chess Server , is EdCollins.  I'm a former Administrator on this site, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.     Interested in knowing how badly you're lagging on
FICS? Although FICS currently does not have its own "ping" command, if
you're running Windows 95 (and probably 98) you can still ping yourself
very easily, without downloading anything at all.  Here's
how.   Whoops! As
of Friday, March 12, 1999 FICS now DOES have its own "ping" command so the info above is now for
die-hards only!   Here are  eight different FICS login screens  I designed. There is nothing wrong with the one FICS is currently
using, but I felt it would be a refreshing change to see something new
when we log on. I'd like to see one of these implemented, but I had fun
designing them even if the powers that be choose not to do so.  Here
are my suggestions to improve / enhance FICS.            The worst
and most often heard chess joke / pun... usually heard at
Christmas:  A group
of chess enthusiasts checked into a hotel and were standing in the lobby discussing their recent tournament
victories. The hotel manager immediately came over and asked them to disperse. "But why?" they asked. "Because," he said, "I can't stand chess nuts
boasting in an open foyer."          Can you solve this logic problem?  A game started with 1.f3 and ended with 5... Kf6#.  How did the game go?  Note: It's
not all that hard to figure out. Give it a try before you look at...       From the starting position, how many moves do you
think it would take you to achieve a position where both sides have 9
Queens? Try it yourself and then see what is believed to be  the
ultimate solution.    Here's a logic problem with a chess
theme!   One
of my favorite chess compositions!  This one is a must see!     Chess on Jeopardy! The TV game show Jeopardy recently had "Chess Mania" as a category!  Check it out!   60 different newspaper comic strips  all with
a chess-related theme!    If you enjoy playing chess at Yahoo!, I hope you're
aware of the advantages the chess servers offer over that site. If not,

Life , I was fortunate enough to have one of my letters published in their
monthly Letters To The Editor column! I wrote this letter in rebuttal to a few other letters that
were published a couple of months prior to that.  My current record in OTB rated tournaments is 157 wins, 129 losses, 64 draws.  Here's a  list
of the tourneys  I've entered.     The Category 17 (2674) Hoogovens Tournament in Wijk aan Zee was held from January 16th, through Jan 31st, 1999. The event included Kasparov, Anand, Shirov, Svidler, Kramnik,
Yermolinsky, Topalov and several other top GM's.  Here
is the final crosstable of the event  and all of the games in a PGN format.  _________________________  Here

without ever entering the g2 square? (You can't enter the g2 square...

with chess? The answer is  Detective Chess ,
a delightful little game in which the object is to logically determine
the positions of some pieces on a chessboard. The above link points to
the author's homepage.    If
your Internet chess interface is still saving your games in what is
known as the "oldmoves format" you may be interested in a  conversion
utility  I wrote awhile ago which will convert a file from this format into a
PGN formatted file.  (Note:
most interfaces nowadays are able to save your games straight to a PGN
file.)      How to create a random Fischer Random opening position  with
the help of a single die.    Computer ingenuity solves old chess puzzle      Here's
an entertaining article I found titled  Winboard
Modularity, Engines and Chess Servers .  My only fault
with this article is that it's not long enough.   Photos from the 2001 National Open     In
1999 I completed a 15 round, single round-robin tournament between 16
of my WinBoard-compatible freeware chess engines. The story, results,

			of Problems                     Remember the Garry Kasparov - Deep Blue rematch that
was held in May of '97?    Here's a
couple of limericks  I wrote on that match.   The 12
actual games Garry played against Deep Blue, from both matches, can be
found here.   After the
above mentioned match,  Deep Blue was interviewed.     Here is a   copy
of the interview   Garry Kasparov gave on ICC on 11 / 22 / 1998.   Here's a humorous WAV file (234 KB in size) in
which Gary Kasparov and Deep Blue compete in... are you ready for
this... a swimming match! I
liked it! The length of the WAV file lasts for about a minute and a
half. The quality originally was terrible -- the volume was much too
low and you could hear a lot of static and hiss in the background. I
took the time to increase the volume and filter out some of the noise.
It's still not great... but it is much better.   The 24

a text
file , in PGN
format, of 731 of Bobby's tournament games.    Note
that this file is more accurate than many other similar files you will
find on the Internet. For one, all PGN tags for his name are identical.
(Some Fischer game files list one game as "R Fischer" and than the next
game as "Robert Fischer" and then another game as "Fischer, R" etc.)
This file also has duplicate games eliminated, something a few other
files I have found do not. Third, when at all possible, all games have
been placed in chronological order.  It's about 486,000 bytes in size, so it will take a few moments to

Fischer beat Spassky in Iceland in '72. I know a girl who's better looking but who thinks like Bobby Fischer
too. When Bobby Fischer was a kid they knew he was a prodigy. I know a girl who's somewhat older but no less of an authority.  I wish I
had the smarts to understand her charts. If I don't concentrate she'll have me in checkmate.  In Tampa
Bay and Lafayette they all know Bobby Fischer's name. I know a girl who made her mark in smaller cities but her fame's the
same. When Bobby Fischer made his comeback in the '90s he was worse for wear. I know a girl who made a comeback but her mind was altogether there.  She said:
"I drink chocolate milk, from a cow I built. “Doot n'doot doot doot. Doot n'doot doot doot."  They're

Fischer appeared on the cover.               Speaking
of Fischer, we do have one thing in common -- we've both defeated
players who are now Grandmasters! I was fortunate enough to defeat Tal Shaked in a simul he gave at  The Chess Emporium  in Phoenix, Arizona not so long ago and
young Tal has recently become a Grandmaster! Congratulations Tal! (And
yes, I saved the signed scoresheet!!)  However,
my friend Brent Bowers, who was sitting to my immediate right, went one
better. First he defeated Tal, then he played him again and held him to a draw !
Good work, Brent!  We
still have a joke about his first game. Tal saw the win long before
Brent did. Tal: I resign . Brent: Why??  Here's
a piece of advice: If an International Master ever resigns to you, don't
ask why!                 Although this chess program will interest almost none
of you, I'm putting a copy of it up here anyway because hey, this is MY
homepage. <grin>  It's a
chess program called  EdChess . Back in the days before one downloaded freeware and shareware programs 
		off the Internet, one went to computer trade shows to get this kind of
stuff.  Years ago (around 1990) for two bucks I purchased this program
at such a trade show. (In fact, I still have the original 5 1/4 inch
diskette!)  I recently
took a look at it this program again and it brought back a lot of
memories. It's a chess program with the simplest of graphics... if you
can call them graphics. It uses ASCII characters to display the pieces!  The
program was written by David Hendricks and John T. Bell over a period
of three years. This is version 2.30 and to my knowledge, was the last
version released.  The four
files that make up the program are zipped up and are only about 78KB in
size.  (Trust me,
if you don't wish to download this I won't be disappointed.)

            is a collection of the strongest overall tournament performances. I
            have made an effort not to repeat the same player too many times. I
            have also split up the performances into two categories - the
            strongest statistically and powerful modern performances. Some of
            the openings played in the first collection have become out of date.
            The second collection will include some more recognisable and trendy
            lines. My source for judging these performances is Jeff Sonas, the
            webmaster of the well known Chess
              Metrics website. Note there is currently a problem with
            Windows 7 machines, which block the online chess viewer via the
            security system.   For the
            most comfortable experience, I recommend you download the games from
            the pages of your choice and view them in the free high-definition

            between raw strength and user-friendliness can be achieved. As far
            as I can see, the IPON and CEGT rating lists are the most active.    CCRL    CEGT    IPON    SSDF     Australian
