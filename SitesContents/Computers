In 2004, after the merger between Unisa and Technicon Southern Africa and the incorporation of the distance education component of Vista (VUDEC) to form the new Unisa, the department changed its name to the School of Computing (SoC). In 2013 SoC moved to the Unisa Science Campus in Florida, Johannesburg.  The SoC has established itself, and gained a reputation as a leader in Computing for various reasons:   More than 80,000 module registrations from all over the world  More than 300 active Master's and Doctoral students  Well qualified and experienced staff  Internationally recognised research publications annually in four main research focus areas: Applied Research in Computer Science (ARCS), Educational Technology, ICT4D, a flagship research group, Information Systems, Security4U and Software Engineering.  9 NRF-rated researchers  Hosts the Centre for Software Engineering (CENSE) that offers a number of specialised short learning programmes   Two noteable milestones are:  SoC became the first South African university to offer HCI (Human Computer Interaction) courses at post- and undergraduate level. In 2007 Prof Paula Kotze (B3 NRF) became the first woman researcher in the college to receive an NRF B rating.

They typically received in-service training in the "technology of the day", which becomes obsolete within a short period of time. Enterprises are aware of this, and prefer that employees are educated in the fundamentals of the discipline. The aim of the Centre for Software Engineering's short learning programmes is to provide an environment where students can study the underlying principles of a particular field of interest and be rewarded with a UNISA certificate upon successful completion of the course. Some courses focus strongly on practical issues with various sessions of training while other courses focus on the theoretical principles forming the basis of a particular field.

S. Shrungeshwara, Kireet Kumar, Pallabee Choudhury, Rakesh K. Dumka and Harsh Bhu  We estimate a new angular velocity for the India plate and contemporary deformation rates in the plate interior and along its seismically active margins from Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements from 1996 to 2015 at 70 continuous and 3 episodic stations. A new India-ITRF2008 angular velocity is estimated from 30 GPS sites, which include stations from western and eastern regions of the plate interior that were unrepresented or only sparsely sampled in previous studies. Our newly estimated India-ITRF2008 Euler pole is located significantly closer to the plate with ~3% higher angular velocity than all previous estimates and thus predicts more rapid variations in rates and directions along the plate boundaries. The 30 India plate GPS site velocities are well fit by the new angular velocity, with north and east RMS misfits of only 0.8 and 0.9 mm/yr, respectively. India fixed velocities suggest an approximate of 1–2 mm/yr intra-plate deformation that might be concentrated along regional dislocations, faults in Peninsular India, Kachchh and Indo-Gangetic plain. Relative to our newly-defined India plate frame of reference, the newly estimated velocities for 43 other GPS sites along the plate margins give insights into active deformation along India’s seismically active northern and eastern boundaries.

These models are tested extensively and used globally to estimate PWV for low altitude sites (below 1000 m amsl). The moist parameters used in the model are: water vapor scale height (Hc), dew point temperature (Td) and water vapor pressure (Es0). These moist parameters are derived from surface air temperature and relative humidity measured at high temporal resolution from automated weather station. The performance of these models are examined statistically with observed high-resolution GPS (GPSPWV) data over the region (2005–2012). The correlation coefficient (R) between the observed GPSPWV and Model PWV is 0.98 at daily data and varies diurnally from 0.93 to 0.97. Parameterization of moisture parameters were studied in-depth (i.e., 2 h to monthly time scales) using GPSPWV, Td, and Es0. The slope of the linear relationships between GPSPWV and Td varies from 0.073°C−1 to 0.106°C−1 (R: 0.83 to 0.97) while GPSPWV and Es0 varied from 1.688 to 2.209 (R: 0.95 to 0.99) at daily, monthly and diurnal time scales. In addition, the moist parameters for the cold desert, high-altitude environment are examined in-depth at various time scales during 2005–2012.

A new long-time series (1998–2009) of geodetic, static Global Positioning System (GPS) dataset suggests that active deformation in the Darjiling-Sikkim Himalaya (DSH) is not confined to the Himalayan front as previously believed. Instead, the ∼9 mm/yr N-S active convergence here is divided almost equally within the Lesser Himalayan Duplex (LHD) and the Higher Himalaya due to aseismic reverse slip of ∼18 mm/yr on the Himalayan décollement (Main Himalayan thrust (MHT)) dipping 6° → 006° and locked at ∼16 km depth. Slip transfer along the MHT causes minor to moderate earthquakes at the brittle-ductile transition in the DSH. Measured East velocities show no systematic variation indicating that strike-slip seismicity, though dominant in the region, does not alleviate the décollement (MHT) seismic hazard. Continued slip along the MHT, therefore, will cause a great décollement earthquake in the region. Also, GPS velocities vary in the eastern and western DSH suggesting segmentation of the Himalayan arc along a transverse fault over geological to decadal time scales. Our integrated approach can provide better insight into active deformation in convergent wedges worldwide.

Monitoring the state of cellular data connectivity in India The count of mobile Internet users in India has been growing at a rate of 27% annually and is expected to reach 300M by 2017. There is however limited understanding of whether this rapid growth is happening while also ensuring that good quality of service is provided to users. To find out, we deployed a measurement framework in 20 rural,
semi-urban, and urban sites in North India and probed four ... Analysis of the Spread of Information on Twitter and its Application to Internet Content Distribution With rapidly growing traffic volumes on the Internet, service providers are finding it increasingly hard to manage delivery of content to end users. We observe that a large portion of the traffic is contributed and accessed by Online Social Networking (OSN) websites, and we attempt to leverage this fact to build better content placement and caching strategies for Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). ... The rich and middle classes on Twitter: Are popular users indeed different from regular users? Online social networking (OSN) websites such as Twitter and Facebook are known to have a wide heterogeneity in the popularity of their users, counted typically in terms of the number of followers or friends of the users. We add to the large body of work on information diffusion on online social networking websites, by studying how the behavior of the small minority of very popular users on Twitter... Optimal Radius for Connectivity in Duty-Cycled Wireless Sensor Networks We investigate the condition on transmission radius needed to achieve connectivity in duty-cycled wireless sensor networks (briefly, DC-WSN). First, we settle a conjecture of Das et. al. (2012) and prove that the connectivity condition on Random Geometric Graphs (RGG), given by Gupta and Kumar (1989), can be used to derive a weak sufficient condition to achieve connectivity in DCWSN. To find a str... Sec-X: A Framework for Collecting Runtime Statistics for SoCs with Multiple Accelerators We are moving into an era where large SoCs will have a portfolio of different kinds of cores and accelerators. Many of these computational elements might be designed by third parties. In this setting, it is beneficial to collect accurate runtime information such that we can diagnose performance problems, verify and report correctness issues, and collect usage scenarios of third party hardware. Thi... Fast Dynamic Binary Translation for the Kernel Dynamic binary translation (DBT)  is a  powerful technique with several important applications. System-level binary  translators  have  been  used  for  implementing  a Virtual Machine Monitor [2] and for instrumentation in the OS kernel [10].  In current designs, the performance overhead of binary translation on kernel-intensive workloads is high. e.g., over 10x slowdowns were reported on the sys... MajSynth : An n-input Majority Algebra based Logic Synthesis Tool for Quantum-dot Cellular Automata We need specialized logic synthesis methods to exploit the 3-
input Majority gate, the primary logic element of the emerging
Quantum-dot Cellular Automata paradigm. Existing methods
take a narrow approach of manipulating functions into a network
of 3-input Majority functions with no knowledge of larger
Majority functions, and hence fall short while minimizing large
Boolean functions.
In thi... Building citizen engagement into the implementation of welfare schemes in rural India Citizen feedback on the implementation of social welfare schemes can help fine tune their design, understand problems, and assess the benefits and impact from these schemes. Such feedback loops however are singularly missing in most schemes in India, and are conveyed only indirectly via civil society and social audit organizations that try to serve as a bridge between citizens and the government. ... Result Clustering for Keyword Search on Graphs Graph structured data on the web is now massive as well as diverse, ranging from

of these queries to structured queries, etc. In this project, we are con... Sampling and Reconstruction using Bloom Filters In this paper, we address the problem of sampling
from a set and reconstructing a set stored as a Bloom filter. To
the best of our knowledge our work is the first to address this
question. We introduce a novel hierarchical data structure called

extract an almost uniform sample from the set stored in a
Bloom filter and also allows u... Towards developing a Technical Knowledge-Base for Personalized Learning A commonly faced challenge by enthusiastic learners is to build a complete and well-rounded understanding of a topic of interest.

Prof. Krishna Moorthy Sivalingam  Head of the Department Department of Computer Science and Engineering Indian Institute of Technology Madras Chennai - 600036     DomLock: A New Multi-Granularity Locking Technique for Hierarchies Authors : Saurabh Kalikar, Rupesh Nasre 21st ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP 2016)        Effective Synchronization in Parallel Programs : We present an algebraic model of synchronization for hierarchical data structures.
Each element of the algebraic structure denotes a synchronization option and represents a trade-off between the amount of concurrency and the cost of synchronization.
The algebraic formulation forms the basis for a framework of synchronization mechanisms on a hierarchical data structure.
Effective synchronization is key to scalable parallelization.
Several applications work on an abstract hierarchy of objects, and a parallel
execution on this hierarchy necessitates synchronization across workers
operating on different parts of the hierarchy.
Existing synchronization mechanisms are either too coarse, too inefficient, or too ad hoc,
resulting in reduced or unpredictable amount of concurrency.
With our formulation, we offer a range of possibilities in choosing synchronization in a hierarchical structure.       Global Excellence and Local Relevance in research, teaching, and technology 
development is the vision of the Department. The Department was started as the Computer Centre in 1973 with the acquisition of an IBM 370, perhaps 
the most powerful computer in India at that time. It offered M.Tech, M.S and PhD degree programmes. In 1983, the B.Tech degree programme was
