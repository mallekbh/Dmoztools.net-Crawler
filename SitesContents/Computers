As the computing field continues to evolve, and new computing-related disciplines emerge, existing curriculum reports will be updated, and additional reports for new computing disciplines will be drafted.  Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report  CC2005 provides undergraduate curriculum guidelines for five defined sub-disciplines of computing:   Computer Engineering  Computer Science  Information Systems  Information Technology  Software Engineering   Computer Engineering   CE2016 : Computer Engineering Curricula 2016 (English)  CE2016 : Computer Engineering Curricula 2016 (Chinese)  CE2004 : Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Engineering   Computer Science   CSEC2017 : Curriculum Guidelines for Post-Secondary Degree Programs in Cybersecurity  CS2013 : Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Computer Science  (English)  CS2013: Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Computer Science (Chinese)  CS2008 Curriculum Update : The Computing Curricula Computer Science Volume is complete and approved.

Everything ACM accomplishes is through the efforts of people like you. A wide range of activities keep ACM moving, including organizing conferences, editing journals, reviewing papers and participating on boards and committees, to name just a few. Find out all the ways that you can volunteer with ACM.          ACM Case Studies   Written by leading domain experts for software engineers, ACM Case Studies provide an in-depth look at how software teams overcome specific challenges by implementing new technologies, adopting new practices, or a combination of both. Often through first-hand accounts, these pieces explore what the challenges were, the tools and techniques that were used to combat them, and the solution that was achieved.         Why I Belong to ACM   Hear from Bryan Cantrill, vice president of engineering at Joyent, Ben Fried chief information officer at Google, and Theo Schlossnagle, OmniTI founder on why they are members of ACM.
