Starbucks arrests stir introspection over hidden prejudice    The handcuffing of two black men for refusing to leave a Starbucks is fraught ground for America's corporations, many of which have seen employees use racist stereotypes.

Less noise. More insight.      SUBSCRIBE TODAY              About Monitor Journalism  We think it is time to rethink the news.  News is essential. It is the fuel for a thriving democracy. It takes us to places and introduces us to people we never imagined. It defends our rights and values.  Over the Monitor’s 108-year history, we’ve built a legacy of high-quality, distinctive journalism because we recognize that news is more than facts. It’s the story of how we are each trying to make our homes, communities, and nations better. What matters are the values and ideals that drive us, not just the who, what, when, and where of the news.  When we understand that, we understand the world, and one another, better.  The Monitor gives readers that deeper insight by offering this approach to readers:  We challenge conventional thinking. As forces from politics to social media try to break us into competing tribes – political, racial, or economic – together we’ll rethink the question, “Who is my neighbor?”  We listen to you. We need you to hold us accountable – to keep us honest and grounded. To inspire us with what inspires you. Together, we can build a community of people who ask more from news.  We will change how you see news. News must be accurate and trustworthy, but facts alone can miss the whole story – the story of us. We are much better than much of today’s news portrays us to be. We will have the courage to look into both the best and the worst in us – and not to blame, but to demand better.  Journalism can be a force for good – for inspiration and progress. But only if we all make it so.
