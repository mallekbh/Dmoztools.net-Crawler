The rules come in different forms, some restrict players from being a certain age such as 25, some start a clock at a certain age such as 21, others look to take one year of eligibility away per year of outside competition used in any form of that sport played in a competitive league. Anyway you slice it, these limitations and restritions created have only one goal in common: they are made to stop older and more experienced players. They do only one thing: create a younger, more youth geared league with less talent and more watered down play.  It affects many sports. They are: Baseball, Basketball, Cross Country, Football, Hockey, Soccer, Swimming, Track and Field, Volleyball, Wrestling, Field Hockey and Rugby. It affects many universities. They are: Acadia University, University College of Cape Breton, Dalhousie University, Memorial University of Newfoundland, UniversitÃ© de Moncton, Mount Allison University, University of New Brunswick, University of Prince Edward Island, Saint Francis Xavier University, Saint Mary's University, St. Thomas University, University of Alberta, Brandon University, University of British Columbia, University of Calgary, University of Lethbridge, University of Manitoba, University of Regina, University of Saskatchewan, University of Victoria, Simon Fraser University, Trinity Western University, University of Winnipeg, Brock University, Carleton University, University of Guelph, Lakehead University, Laurentian University, McMaster University, Nipissing University, University of Ottawa, Queen's University, Royal Military College of Canada, Ryerson Polytechnic University, University of Toronto, Trent University, University of Waterloo, University of Western Ontario, Wilfrid Laurier University, University of Windsor, York University, Bishop's University, Concordia University, UniversitÃ© Laval, McGill University, UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec Ã  MontrÃ©al, UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec Ã  Trois-RiviÃ¨res, UniversitÃ© de Sherbrooke. This rule is wide spread and will affect many student athletes.  However, the Canadian Interuniversity Sport has recently said that this rule will only be used in the sport of football and only the institutions of Saint Mary's Huskies, Acadia Axemen, Saint Francis Xavier X-Men, Mount Allison Mounties, Laval Rouge et Or, Concordia Stingers, McGill Redmen, Bishop's Gaiters, McMaster Marauders, Ottawa Gee-Gees, Western Ontario Mustangs, Queen's Golden Gaels, Waterloo Warriors, Laurier Golden Hawks, Guelph Gryphons, York Yeomen, Windsor Lancers, Toronto Varsity Blues, Manitoba Bisons, Regina Rams, Saskatchewan Huskies, Calgary Dinos, British Columbia Thunderbirds and Alberta Golden Bears would be then affected. This left many schools and the sports of Baseball, Basketball, Cross Country, Hockey, Soccer, Swimming, Track and Field, Volleyball, Wrestling, Field Hockey and Rugby alone while only aiming to change football as its lone target in progression towards NCAA rules.  In these days in which the NCAA now realizes what a mistake they have made with putting rules and regulations on limiting and restricting future student-athletes to the Division One, which has forced student athletes to forget joining NCAA DI and join the pros professional league drafts in Basketball and Hockey, and what a success the non-rule version of the NCAA in Division Two has become, they are now looking to not only deregulate amateurism but destroy the whole virtue of amateur sport by allowing former professional athletes to come back and use up their college eligibility they didn't before. Before CIS makes hte same mistake, perhaps they should just keep the system they already have before a scenerio not even dreamed would become a reality as we are seeing in the South.     The University of Regina Rams Football Program went out and recruited players with both more age and years of experience on them. Due to that hark work and preserverance, the Rams went to National Championships and were a top ranked squad in the nation during those older recruit's time in the sun bringing Regina much glory. Older and added years equals quality and choice play making ofr a better overall system.   The Florida State University Seminoles Football Program went out and recruited players with both more age and years of experience on them. Due to that hark work and preserverance, the Seminoles went to National Championships and were a top ranked squad in the nation during those older recruit's time in the sun bringing Florida State much glory. Older and added years equals quality and choice play making ofr a better overall system.            Aubrey Cummings is a perfect example of a player who became a student athlete at a later stage in life. His age wasn't a factor when the Hamilton native born in Ontario in 1970 decided to play CIAU Football. Since CIAU is an amateur organization like many Olympic sports associations, it has had a history of allowing players join and play beyond the current trend of 21 and under. But while the Canadian Olympic Association would never think of barring participation of any amateur athlete, especially those over the age of 25, the CIS has brought the idea up in serious talks. Yet, the CIS, formerly CIAU, has had a grand tradition of using great players like Aubrey Cummings, who have been aged in maturity and experienced in the game, making CIS Sports a better and stronger overall product.    Cummings never played university football at the University of Ottawa. Instead, he played with the Gee Gees basketball squad from 1993-95 and worked at the sport for the three years he was in Ottawa starting at age 22. Giving up on the sport of basketball, he transfered to Acadia University to play in the Atlantic Universities Athletic Association for two seasons from 1996-97. Not only was he voted on to the first team and second team All-Canadian position but he was also a Hec Creighton Trophy nominee from the Atlantic Football Conference as a wide receiver at the prime age of 27, which only recently has become a sin to be in the world of sports. But he got his full five years of eligibility in different CIAU sports.   In the end, thanks to CIAU Football and their traditions of allowing all and any student-athlete to play its sports, Aubrey achieved at such high levels that the Calgary Stampeders in the Western Division of the Canadian Football League drafted him as a wide receiver in 1998 and let him get to the Grey Cup in his rookie year and win the championship final in his second in 1999 and fourth in 2001. All of these student athletes never dreamed of getting drafted or using university as a chance to go professional, when asked, they all say what we all feel - they just wanted to play the sport at the CIAU or CIS / NCAA level.          The stories of both Darryl Leason with Canada's Canadian Interuniversity Sport and Chris Weinke with United States' National Collegiate Athletic Association show just why rules, deemed by some as elitist and ageist, created to either hinder or even bar future and current student athletes on basis of over the age and years of experience aren't only wrong but will change a system that has worked to benefit people and make society a better place. Without heroes like Darryl and Chris, the sports world in the venue of university and college sports wouldn't be as fair or . By stopping these anti people rules against these two groups from being enacted, it will continue the tradition of university and college sports by allowing its athletes the opportunity to study and gain a top notch education while continuing to play sport at a highly competitive level. This sense of open mindness comes from the legal backing from the Constitution, Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Human Rights Commission and Supreme Court which is only entrenched in Canada. These individuals in Leason and Weinke are people that represent these freedoms, our rights and these country's democracy.       Darryl Leason joined the CIAU football at age 22 as a freshmen after years of junior league football. Born in Hudson Bay, Sask. on the year 1973, he took the courage to come back at a later age and show all kids in Canada that you can go back to school anytime, if you wish. Leason spent four years playing with the Regina Rams of the Prairie Football Conference from 1992-95 before deciding to enroll in university and after with the Calgary Wolfpack of the Alberta Football League from 1999-2000. His time away from the university campus gave him the chance to experience life differently yet position himself to reconform with university football and join with the University of Calgary Dinosaurs in 1996 and the University of Regina Rams in 2000. In his final years as a Quarterback, he was touted as a candidate and winner for the Hec Creighton Trophy, for the country's most valuable university football player, and had been to several National Championship CWUAA Vanier Hardy Cup games as a fifth year senior in 2001 ending his time at U of R Rams as a superior standout university student athlete at 27. Ironically, his compatriot, Mike Wong, who will leave in 2003, joined with the Rams a year after 1996, when Leason left Regina, in 1997. Darryl Leason signed a professional free agent contract in with the Canadian Football League's Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 2001.   Chris Weinke joined the NCAA football at age 23 as a freshmen after years of minor league baseball. Born in St. Paul, Minn. on the year 1972, he took the courage to come back at a later age and show all kids in America that you can go back to school anytime, if you wish. Weinke spent six years playing with the Knoxville Smokies of the Southern Class AA Baseball League from 1991-96 before deciding to enroll in college. His time away from the college campus gave him the chance to experience life differently yet position himself to reconform with college football and rejoin with the Florida State University Seminoles in 1997. In his final years as a Quarterback, he was touted as a candidate and winner for the John Heisman Trophy, for the country's most valuable college football player, and had been to several National Championship BSC Sugar Orange Bowl games as a fourth year senior in 2000 ending his time at FSU Seminoles as a superior standout college student athlete at 28. Ironically, his compatriot, Charlie Ward, who left in 1993, joined with Weinke as Florida State rookies together in before he left the Seminoles early 1990. Chris Weinke signed a professional draft pick contract in with the National Football League's Carolina Panthers in 2001.          This rule would ensure that Golden Boys like Quarterback Drew Henson of the University of Michigan Wolverines from Brighton would be the Americanized rich and young recruit system Canada sorely wants to believe it can adapt to. That type of thinking is the stuff of Northern dreams, of 18 year old graduating and having enough money to learn and play at the university level immediately. That, realistically, just isn't the case in Canada where one will be luck to start at 20 or 21 if even then. Rules on age and experience must be stopped so not to restrict any person from competing when they can't even pay to enter university. We must allow all people's to have the freedom to plan their lives on the different situation they currently live in.  Making this into an issue that makes the student athlete look as though they are playing football only or are there to go professional isn't true or fair. Having mature teams today is just a fact and will be an accurate reflection of the average student age at their schools soon into the future. As tuitions rise, so will the ages of the student athletes and that is a reality. Student Athletes may be young now becoming the minority but that will so change. The only people that will make and meet the five year rule requirement will be student athletes with enough money and rich enough to go to university right out of high school and that just isn't fair nor right. Sports, like education, should be open to all student athletes no matter what the age or the years of experience behind them.  Finally, this rule is in direct conflict with Section 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The exact paragraph is 15. (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. and (2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. With the Human Rights Commission and the Supreme Court of Canada in the corner of the disadvantaged mature student who is in the minority on this issue, you can bet the bottom dollar this rule could be, should be and would be defeated in the courts of justice here in this great and mighty nation. Beware the trampling of minority's and people's rights Canadian Interuniversity Sport Football Directors and Coaches because legal action, not compassionate thinking, may force you to think twice!  UPDATE from http://www.creationcenter.com/boards/allcanadianorth/: CIS Executive Finds Middle Ground Compromise For All THANKS  Universities look to level football field  Canadian Interuniversity Sport reached a compromise on one of the hot topics at its annual general meeting, which wrapped up yesterday in Alymer, Que.  An attempt to level the field among the football schools will see players who have graduated high school and have more than two years experience at any other level of tackle football in Canada lose a year of CIS eligibility for each additional year played.  Time spent playing in Europe or not playing at all does not count against CIS eligibility. Quebec-educated players are allowed three years experience because they graduate in Grade 11.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“What theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve looked at is years of playing experience. as opposed to age,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Peter Baxter, athletic director at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ont. and convenor for the Ontario football conference.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t penalize the player who is, say, 22 and hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t played football for a couple of years, but it also doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t allow you to play two years of CEGEP and four or five years of junior football, then play five more in university.Ã¢â‚¬Â      The CIS and NCAA Age and Years restriction limitation rule will hurt and harm University Sport as is. First, the United States in the NCAA and, now, Canada in the CIS, this trend towards youth only sports has destroyed the tradition we have proved works and makes athletics a better society with aged people.   at Canadian Interuniversity Sport forum, National Collegiate Athletic Association forum and Canadian Amateur Football website for all members of the Canadian Northern Senior Junior Football League Conference.
