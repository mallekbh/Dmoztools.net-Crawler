Work, you know. When you notice lack of action here, though, that doesn’t mean that I’m being completely idle. Not always, anyway. Check on Twitter and Facebook , if you dare, and you’ll see new stuff on a fairly regular basis, because that’s easier to do than a fully-fledged blog post. Anyway, what I’ll do here is a mega-Nibble hoovering up snippets from the past few weeks that I posted on social media but not here. I’ll leave it on the main page for a few days, than relegate it to the sidebar as usual.   Vegetable History 101.  If you have a heirloom of one of the above to name, try this neural network approach .  Just as long as the name doesn’t end up being racist .  It’s too late for some German veggies . Though not, it seems, for German forests . What’s the difference?  Not yet too late for Tanzanian wild veggies , but winter is coming. Maybe giving them cool names would help.  And for some North American indigenous crops too, thanks to some committed people.  And for beans in Mexico for that matter.  Why all the above is important .  And urgent .  And this is the resulting problem if you ignore that lesson.  You see, the Australians are on the case, with their bush tucker fixation.  Mind you, it’s not all sweetness and light: the quinoa bubble bursts .  Maybe we can make a game of this diversification lark. Oh, look, it seems we can .  Wherein I pontificate about genebank data . Again.  Maybe these guys will listen?  These guys obviously did, and built a better peanut .  Yeah, but can you see them from space ?  The cost of ending hunger . The cost of ensuring crop diversity conservation in genebanks seems, well, peanuts.  The archaeology of gardens . Two of my favourite topics, combined. If only there was beer too. And peanuts.  A banana is a banana is a banana . Not.  All those bananas? You can help to map them .  They’ll put them on Google Earth next, like Kew did for these beautiful natural areas , with all their crop wild relatives :)  A Japanese agricultural encyclopaedia . Illustrated to boot.  Or, for the more Euro-centric, food art at the Met …  This cheese should probably be at the Met there too.  And this weed strain may well soon be on sale in the gift shop.  The sweet potato made it to Oceania on its own .  Oh no it didn’t .  On the other hand, livestock generally need to be accompanied.  All the yeast belong China .       Posted on  April 19, 2018 April 19, 2018 How to treat those seeds right    The scientific program of this workshop will place seed longevity into a conservation context: ex situ conservation of genetic resources through in situ conservation of wild habitat.  The role of seeds in conservation efforts is often marginalized or understated as simply a ‘means to an end.’  Yet, seed longevity is often the basis of successful conservation efforts because it underpins successful stand re-establishment after disturbance, efficient maintenance of crop diversity, and effective management decisions for commercial seed lots.  Seed longevity is a complex trait, in which the environment of growth, harvest, processing and storage may interact in unpredictable ways with inherent seed traits.  The longevity phenotype itself is difficult to measure as it encompasses both potential and risk, both of which can only be realized in the future.  “This workshop” is the 2nd Seed Longevity Workshop , at Ft Collins, Colorado, 30 July – 1 August 2018. Looks unmissable. I particularly like this bit from the programme :  Time will be reserved in each late afternoon for discussion of current and potentially controversial issues over refreshments:   Using accelerated conditions to forecast longevity; we do it for food and drugs, why not seeds? (led by Olivier Leprince and Julia Buitink, INRA France)  Improving seed banking best practices and standards (led by Fiona Hay, Aarhus Univ, Denmark)  What about seeds that don’t fit the longevity models? – intermediate/recalcitrant and exceptional ( sensu Pence) seed paradigms (leaders TBD)    I hadn’t heard of “exceptional” species, but it turns out it just means those which are troublesome to conserve as seeds, because either recalcitrant or just not very prolific .  Anyway, looks like a lot of cool people will be there.      Posted on  April 9, 2018 April 9, 2018 Where to find stressed rice in Nigeria    So last week’s Brainfood led with a paper mapping various abiotic stresses affecting rice in Africa, noting that the next step would be to mash up the results with germplasm provenances.  Well, I decided to do it myself. Here’s the distribution of “iron-rich soils” in Nigeria and potentially affected rice area (the paper’s Fig. 8b), the latter coming from the SPAM project we have alluded to before as a source of data on crop cultivation .   The yellow rings are African rice landraces, the red dots all rice landraces, both from Genesys. If you click on the map, you’ll see it much better, and notice that there’s not much rice germplasm from the more brownish areas, denoting rice cultivation areas with Fe-richer soils. Should these be targets for collecting? Kind of depends if landraces are still grown in those places, but it’s a start.      Posted on  April 9, 2018 April 9, 2018 Brainfood: Vine breeding, Moroccan veggie erosion, Potato charisma, Pigeonpea diversity, Dietary diversity, Cannabis breeding, Cattle domestication, Late blight gene     Vitis vinifera L. fruit diversity to breed varieties anticipating climate changes . Nice, but isn’t this leaving it rather late?  The Deterioration of Morocco’s Vegetable Crop Genetic Diversity: An Analysis of the Souss-Massa Region . 80-90% loss in 30 years.  Interspecies Respect and Potato Conservation in the Peruvian Cradle of Domestication . Some varieties have more charisma than others.  Quantitative Analysis, Distribution and Traditional Management of Pigeon Pea [ Cajanus Cajan (L.) Millsp.] Landraces’ Diversity in Southern Benin . Larger farms have slightly more varieties, otherwise difficult to find socioeconomic correlates of diversity; main criterion for choosing varieties is market value.  Higher agrobiodiversity is associated with improved dietary diversity, but not child anthropometric status, of Mayan Achí people of Guatemala . Diversifying diets won’t help without better toilets.  Dwarf germplasm: the key to giant Cannabis hempseed and cannabinoid crops . The mainstreaming of weed continues. The Man unavailable for comment.  Early North African Cattle Domestication and Its Ecological Setting: A Reassessment . No early North African cattle domestication after all?  Identification and rapid mapping of a gene conferring broad-spectrum late blight resistance in the diploid potato species Solanum verrucosum through DNA capture technologies .

Now to mash this up with germplasm provenance information…  Screening of rice landraces ( Oryza sativa L.) for seedling stage salinity tolerance using morpho-physiological and molecular markers . …you know, so that this sort of thing could be predicted, perhaps.  Identification of promising sources for fodder traits in the world collection of pearl millet at the ICRISAT genebank . 14 out of 326. Difficult to predict from environmental data, though, I suspect.  Agricultural diversification as an important strategy for achieving food security in Africa . More diverse households and farming systems are more food secure, but only up to a point, and it depends on various factors. 43% of African cropland will be difficult to diversify.  Deforestation and child diet diversity: A geospatial analysis of 15 Sub-Saharan African countries . Deforestation is bad for diet diversity. No word on overlap with the above mentioned 43%.  Two-thirds of global cropland area impacted by climate oscillations . I bet you that includes most of the above-mentioned 43%.  Exchanging and managing in-vitro elite germplasm to combat Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) and Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) in Eastern and Southern Africa . The devil is in the logistics.

"We need young farmers to buy land, enter the business and stay in our rural communities to raise their families. One of the most difficult challenges for beginning farmers is gaining access to adequate capital. As farming changes, we need to update the programs to meet the loan needs of those that are contemplating a farming career."

This site     is intended as an educational and informational resource on breeds of livestock     throughout the world. We hope you enjoy the information provided and find     it both educational and fun. We see this site as a continually growing resource.     As time passes we will be expanding the educational and scientific information     pertaining to breeds. We already have breeds from every inhabited continent     and we have cooperative projects underway with individuals at a number of     other Universities to add to our listings and to expand existing information.     We would welcome additional cooperative efforts so please let us know.  What is a breed?  The classic definition of a "breed" is usually stated as a variation     of this statement.   Animals that, through selection and breeding, have come to resemble       one another and pass those traits uniformly to their offspring.   Unfortunately this definition leaves some unanswered questions. For example,     when is a crossbred animal considered a composite breed and when do we stop     thinking about them as composites? Perhaps this definition from The Genetics     of Populations by Jay L. Lush helps explain why a good definition of "breed"     is elusive.   A breed is a group of domestic animals, termed such by common consent       of the breeders, ... a term which arose among breeders of livestock, created       one might say, for their own use, and no one is warranted in assigning to       this word a scientific definition and in calling the breeders wrong when       they deviate from the formulated definition. It is their word and the breeders       common usage is what we must accept as the correct definition.   As you can see from Dr. Lush's definition it is at least in part the perception     of the breeders and the livestock industry which decides when a group of individuals     constitutes a "breed".  The development of the breeds takes different routes also. In some breeds     you can see the amount of change that can occur as the result of selection     for a small number of traits. As an example, Holstein cattle have been selected primarily for milk production and are the highest     milk producing cattle in the world. Other breeds have traits that result from     natural selection pressure based upon the environment in which they were developed.     An example of this might be the N'dama cattle from west Africa. These animals have, through the centuries, developed     a resistance to trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness spread by the tse-tse     fly, which is fatal to most other breeds of cattle.  Why are we concerned about preserving information about minor, or relatively     unknown, breeds of livestock?  Is there a reason for the preservation of minor breeds of livestock? Couldn't     more improvement be made if there were fewer breeds? Well, lets go back to     our Holstein example again for a moment.     While the Holstein clearly has an advantage over other breeds in the production     of whole milk, this advantage is based on feeding high levels of cereal grains     and pricing that favors low milk-solids content. A drastic change in either     of these factors could result in a decrease in the advantage of the Holstein.     Given these conditions perhaps a breed that is currently rare or endangered,     such as the Dutch Belted , which displayed     excellent milking ability in a grass-based dairy situation in trials in the     early 1900's, would find itself on the forefront. In Australia, composite     breeds, such as the Australian Friesian     Sahiwal , have been developed which have higher milk production levels     than Holsteins in the tropical regions     of that country. Another example might be an increased need for natural resistance     to diseases or parasites should a current antibiotic or other treatment become     unavailable or ineffective. An example of this type might be the natural resistance some breeds of sheep have to internal parasites. Should anthelmintics become     restricted or uneconomical then a breed such as the critically endangered Gulf Coast Native , with the parasite     resistance it has developed through natural selection, could be of critical     importance in the sheep industry. In many areas, genetic diversity should     be maintained to help meet the potential challenge resulting from changes     in production resources and market requirements. We hope that this project     will serve as an information resource for the potential of some of these breeds.  Why do we have livestock at all? Don't they just eat the food that would     be better utilized by being given directly to people.  Agricultural animals have always made a major contribution to the welfare     of human societies by providing food, shelter, fuel, fertilizer and other     products and services. They are a renewable resource, and utilize another     renewable resource, plants, to produce these products and services. In addition,     the manure produced by the animals helps improve soil fertility and, thus,     aids the plants. In some developing countries the manure cannot be utilized     as a fertilizer but is dried as a source of fuel.  Food is, by far, the most important contribution of agricultural animal,     although they rank well behind plants in total quantity of food supplied.     Plants supply over 80 percent of the total calories consumed in the world.     Animals are a more important source of protein than they are of calories,     supplying one-third of the protein consumed in the world. Meat, milk and fish     are about equal sources of animal protein, supplying, respectively, 35%, 34%     and 27% of the world supply of total protein.  There are many who feel that because the world population is growing at a     faster rate than is the food supply, we are becoming less and less able to     afford animal foods because feeding plant products to animals is an inefficient     use of potential human food. It is true that it is more efficient for humans     to eat plant products directly rather than to allow animals to convert them     to human food. At best, animals only produce one pound or less of human food     for each three pounds of plants eaten. However, this inefficiency only applies     to those plants and plant products that the human can utilize. The fact is     that over two-thirds of the feed fed to animals consists of substances that     are either undesirable or completely unsuited for human food. Thus, by their     ability to convert inedible plant materials to human food, animals not only     do not compete with the humans rather they aid greatly in improving both the     quantity and the quality of the diets of human societies.

Source: FAO Production Yearbook  Table 1 presents some statistics that are ignored by those who would suggest     that we can no longer afford the luxury of animal foods. Only about one-third     of the land area of the world is classified as agricultural. Thus, roughly     two-thirds of the land area of the world is not suited for any sort of agricultural     use because it is covered by cites, mountains, deserts, swamps, snow, etc.     Of the 35 percent that can be devoted to agriculture, less than one-third     (or about 10% of the total land area) can be cultivated and produce plant     products that the human can digest. The remaining two-thirds of the world's     agricultural land is covered by grass, shrubs or other plants that only ruminant     animals can digest. Thus, the inefficiency of animals is not a major concern     since they represent the only way these plants can be converted to human food.     As the human population of the world increases, it is likely that we will     be forced to depend more and more on ruminant animals to meet the increased     demands for food.  Thus far, nothing has been said about monogastric animals. It is true that     swine and poultry can be competitors with the humans for food if they are     produced by the intensive confinement systems widely practiced in the developed     countries. In fact the highest proportion of feed grains and other concentrates,     such as oilseed meals, fed to livestock in the United States are fed to swine     and poultry. Current grain prices make this profitable. This obviously could     change if grain prices increase in the future. However, the high reproductive     rate and favorable feed efficiency of swine and poultry would keep them as     important contributors to the diets of humans.

Makkar, Emily Addonizio and Lemma Gizachew  To better monitor the national and regional livestock sectors and formulate adequate development strategies, it is essential to develop systematic approaches to accurately assess livestock feed supplies and obtain better insight into how feed resources are being utilized. The latter information on use of feed resources is achieved by characterizing the feeding systems. A detailed information on feeding systems in lowlands of Ethiopia is presented here. Also approaches to meet the deficiency of animal feed in the dry seasons are presented.     Read more...      Other "Broadening horizons" stories ...

NATIONAL ACADEMY PRESS
Washington, D.C. 1991  NOTICE: The project that is the subject of this report was approved by the Governing
Board of the National Research Council, whose members are drawn from the councils
of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the
Institute of Medicine. The members of the committee responsible for the report were
chosen for their special competence and with regard for appropriate balance.
This report has been reviewed by a group other than the authors according to procedures
approved by a Report Review Committee consisting of members of the National
Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of
Medicine.
The National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit, self-perpetuating society of
distinguished scholars engaged in scientific and engineering research, dedicated to the
furtherance of science and technology and to their use for the general welfare. Upon
the authority of the charter granted to it by the Congress in 1863, the Academy has a
mandate that requires it to advise the federal government on scientific and technical
matters. Dr. Frank Press is president of the National Academy of Sciences.
The National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964, under the charter of the
National Academy of Sciences, as a parallel organization of outstanding engineers. It
is autonomous in its administration and in the selection of its members, sharing with
the National Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising the federal government.
The National Academy of Engineering also sponsors engineering programs aimed at
meeting national needs, encourages education and research, and recognizes the superior
achievements of engineers. Dr. Robert M. White is president of the National Academy
of Engineering.
The Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences
to secure the services of eminent members of appropriate professions in the examination
of policy matters pertaining to the health of the public. The Institute acts under the
responsibility given to the National Academy of Sciences by its congressional charter
to be an adviser to the federal government and, upon its own initiative, to identify issues
of medical care, research, and education. Dr. Samuel O. Thier is president of the
Institute of Medicine.
The National Research Council was organized by the National Academy of Sciences in
1916 to associate the broad community of science and technology with the Academy's
purposes of furthering knowledge and advising the federal government. Functioning in
accordance with general policies determined by the Academy, the Council has become
the principal operating agency of both the National Academy of Sciences and the
National Academy of Engineering in providing services to the government, the public,
and the scientific and engineering communities. The Council is administered jointly by
both Academies and the Institute of Medicine. Dr. Frank Press and Dr. Robert M.
White are chairman and vice chairman, respectively, of the National Research Council.
The Board on Science and Technology for International Development (BOSTID) of the
Office of International Affairs addresses a range of issues arising from the ways in which
science and technology in developing countries can stimulate and complement the
complex processes of social and economic development. It oversees a broad program
of bilateral workshops with scientific organizations in developing countries and conducts
special studies.
This report was prepared by an ad hoc advisory panel of the Advisory Committee on
Technology Innovation, Board on Science and Technology for International Develop-
ment, Office of International Affairs, National Research Council. Staff support was
funded by the Office of the Science Advisor, Agency for International Development,
under Grant No. DAN-5538-G-SS-1023-00.

1X   Preface

	The purpose of this report is to raise awareness of the potential of
small livestock species and to stimulate their introduction into animal
research and economic development programs. It is geared particularly
towards benefiting developing nations.
	"Microlivestock" is a term we have coined for species that are
inherently small, such as rabbits and poultry, as well as for breeds of
cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs that are less than about half the size of
the most common breeds. These miniature animals are seldom consid-
ered in the broad picture of livestock development, but they seem to
have a promising future. Wherever land is scarce it seems reasonable
to assume that, things being equal, small animals would be more
attractive than large ones. And land for livestock is becoming increas-
ingly scarce.
	In this report we have emphasized multipurpose species with promise
for smallholders. In some species, the promise is immediate; in others,
it is long term, and much research must be undertaken before that
promise can be realized or even understood.
	We have included wild species that seem to have potential as future
livestock. Some are threatened with extinction but are described here
because their economic merits may be the key to acquiring support
for their protection. Also, we have highlighted rare breeds of domes-
ticated species because the current tendency has been to concentrate
on a small number of large breeds, and many potentially valuable
breeds are becoming extinct through neglect.
	The book was prepared after an intensive survey of more than 300
animal scientists in 80 countries. They suggested more than 150 species
for inclusion. The staff then drafted chapters on about 40 species and
these drafts were reviewed by more than 400 researchers worldwide.
The thousands of resulting comments, corrections, and additions were
integrated into the drafts. The panel then met to review the product,
to select the most promising species, and to rework the chapters based
on their own experiences and joint conclusions. The result is the
current 35 chapters. Most of the case studies and accounts of inno-
vations highlighted in the various sidebars were developed by the staff
study director.

MICROLIVESTOCK

	Collectively, this study covers many species, but it by no means
exhausts all the microlivestock possibilities. Lack of space and time
precludes discussion of creatures such as edible insects, snails, worms,
turtles, and bats, which in some regions are highly regarded foods.
Similarly, we have not included aquatic life. These decisions were
arbitrary; perhaps invertebrates and aquatic species can be included
in future volumes.
	This report is addressed to government administrators, technical-
assistance personnel, and researchers in agriculture, nutrition, and
related disciplines who are concerned with helping developing countries
achieve a more efficient and balanced exploitation of their biological
resources. Hence, we deal with the animals in a general way and
do not cover details of biology, husbandry, or economics. A selection
of readings that contains such technical information is cited in
Appendix A.
	A further goal of this project has been to explore the common ground
between the disparate arms of animal science: to show that specialists
in wildlife, zoology, and livestock science have much to learn from
one another's field of expertise; to show that "fanciers" of pigeons,
pheasants, chinchillas, iguanas, and other species may have much to
offer livestock breeders including germplasm; and that those who
raise "obsolete" breeds are not only playing a vital role in the protection
of rare genes but can offer the benefit of their experience to commercial
livestock producers.
	Throughout this report, the scientific names of mammals follow
those in: Mammal Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic
Reference. 1982. J.H. Honacki, K.E. Kinman, and J.W. Koeppl,
editors. Published by Allen Press, Inc.; and the Association of Sys-
tematics Collections, Lawrence, Kansas, USA. All dollar figures are
in U.S. dollars; all ton figures are in metric tons.
	This report has been produced under the auspices of the Advisory
Committee on Technology Innovation (ACTI) of the Board on Science
and Technology for International Development, National Research
Council. ACTI was mandated to assess innovative scientific and
technological advances, with particular emphasis on those appropriate
for developing countries. In this spirit, therefore, the current report
includes some extremely unusual species. Whether these will eventually
prove practical for widespread use is uncertain, but we present them
here for researchers and others who look forward to challenges and
enjoy the satisfaction of successful pioneering. The domestication of
new poultry, as well as the management of rodents, iguanas, and small
deer and antelope, should be viewed in this spirit.
Current titles in the ACTI series on managing tropical animal
resources are:  PREFACE

· The Water Buffalo: New Prospects for an Underutilized Animal
· Little-Known Asian Animals with a Promising Economic Future
· Crocodiles as a Resource for the Tropics
· Butterfly Farming in Papua New Guinea.

	The production of these books has been supported largely by the
Office of the Science Advisor of the U.S. Agency for International
Development (AID), which also made this report possible.







WARNING

	If misunderstood, this book is potentially dangerous. Because of the
severity of the food crisis, the panel has selected some animal~mainly
in the rodent section that are highly adaptable and grow quickly. These
seem appropriate for raising only in areas where they already exist,
which are clearly identified in those chapters. Such potentially invasive
animals should not be introduced to other environments because they
could become serious pests. In any trials, local species should always be
given priority.

UICROLIVESTOCK  In the developing countries, there are over 100 million farms of less
than five hectares, supporting about 700 million people, who represent
about 17 percent of the world population. Even more significant is the
fact that about 50 million farms have less than one hectare of land.

Goat Production in the Tropics

We may now be in the wind down stage of bigger is better animal
selection trend and it has certain!: been a wild ride.... the lesson
now being learned is that the bigger breeding animals . . . cost more
to maintain, are often slower to reproduce, and may even have a
shorter lifespan.

Download Free PDF    Microlivestock is a term coined for species that are inherently small as well as for breeds of cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs that are less than about half the size of the most common breeds. These miniature animals are seldom considered in the broad picture of livestock development, but they seem to have a promising future, especially in developing nations or wherever land is scarce.  This book raises awareness of the potential of these small species, including microcattle, microsheep, various poultry, rabbits, rodents, deer, antelope, and lizards. It also strives to stimulate their introduction into animal research and economic development programs.

Vermicomposting: Composting with Worms  by Soni Cochran, Extension Associate  email this page to a friend   NOTE: The following information is for the home vermicomposting enthusiast. This resource is not intended to be a reference for commercial bins or bins located in businesses, schools, and/or government agencies.    Many gardeners compost both yard waste and kitchen waste with compost piles, sheet composting or some other method during the growing season. Fortunately, very little yard waste is generated during winter months when cold temperatures make composting difficult. However, usable kitchen waste is constantly being generated and must be disposed of. Vermicomposting is the process of using worms and micro-organisms to turn kitchen waste into a black, earthy-smelling, nutrient-rich humus.  Get Started:   You Need 5 Basic Ingredients to Start Vermicomposting:   a container  bedding  water  worms  nonfatty kitchen scraps.   Containers:   In the book, Worms Eat My Garbage , writer *Mary Appelhof suggests weighing your household food waste for one week (in pounds), and then provide one square foot of surface area per pound. The container depth should be between eight and twelve inches. Bins need to be shallow because the worms feed in the top layers of the bedding. A bin that is too deep is not as efficient and could potentially become an odor problem.  Worm boxes can be purchased or made. Plastic storage containers are convenient and come in a variety of sizes. These containers are easily transported and are a nice alternative to heavier wood bins. Many people choose to have several small bins as opposed to one heavier, large wood bin. Small bins work best in homes, apartments and school classrooms. They are easy to tuck under desks, place below kitchen sinks and keep out of the way in laundry rooms.  TIP: If you make a worm bin out of a plastic storage container, never snap the lid shut tight. The lid should lay loosely on the bin.  The large worm bin below (figure 1) is heavier, but is desirable in situations where a bin is going to be outdoors part of the year or in a heated garage. Wood bins allow for a better air movement and a bin this size (figure 1) will take care of food scraps from a family of four.  TIP: If you are truly going to make this an "environmental experience", try making your bin out of an old dresser drawer.   1-2-3 Portable Worm Bin   Depending on the size of the container, drill 8 to 12 holes (1/4 - l/2 inches) in the bottom for aeration and drainage. A plastic bin may need more drainage -- if contents get too wet, drill more holes. Raise the bin on bricks or wooden blocks, and place a tray underneath to capture excess liquid which can be used as liquid plant fertilizer.  The bin needs a cover to conserve moisture and provide darkness for the worms. If the bin is indoors, a sheet of dark plastic or burlap sacking placed loosely on top of the bedding is sufficient as a cover. For outdoor bins, a solid lid is preferable, to keep out unwanted scavengers and rain. Like us, worms need air to live, so be sure to have your bin sufficiently ventilated.  Mary Appelhof's 1-2-3 Portable Worm Bin (1' deep, 2- wide and 3 long). This bin has a bottom so it can be moved and used in a heated garage or basement during cold weather. When a worm box is used outside, it does not need to have a bottom. You may want to line the bottom with rocks or boards to keep rodents and other worm-loving creatures from tunneling in. Wooden boxes will typically last for 2 or 3 years.  Bedding:   The bedding for vermicomposting systems must be able to retain both moisture and air while providing a place for the worms to live. Bedding does not have to be purchased and most of us have plenty of bedding resources in our home, office or school. Here are some suitable sources of bedding.  ** Shredded corrugated cardboard is an excellent bedding, but is difficult to find.  ** Shredded paper like newspaper and computer paper is easy to find, but may dry out quicker than corrugated cardboard. There is not a problem with the ink from the paper.  ** Peat moss has a low pH level that may cause a problem for the worms and it is more expensive.  ** Commercial worm bedding is available in sporting goods stores, but it is also more expensive.  The amount of bedding depends on the size of the box. A 2-by-2 foot box will need between 4 and 6 pounds of dry bedding, a 2-by-3 foot box will take 9 to 14 pounds. No matter what the size, the bin should be 2/3 filled with "fluffed" prepared bedding (see below). For smaller bins, experiment--if you prepare excess bedding, it can be dried, stored and used another time.  Prepare the Bedding:   Water is needed to moisten the bedding. Place the dry, shredded bedding in a large container and add water until it covers the bedding. Allow the bedding to absorb as much water as possible before putting it in the worm bin. This could take from two to 24 hours, depending on the bedding used.  Before putting the bedding in your bin, squeeze the water out from the bedding as much as possible. The bedding should feel like a well-wrung washcloth. Place the bedding in the bin and fluff.  Your bedding needs to remain moist. If it is drying out, mist the paper with water from a spray bottle and dampen the bedding again.  The Worms:   The worms used in vermicomposting are called redworms ( Eisenia foetida ), also know as red wigglers, manure worms, red hybrid or tiger worms.   You can order them through lawn and garden catalogs  There are commercial web sites  You may be able to find them in a bait store  If you know someone who has an established supply, they may be willing to sell you some of their worms.   What About Nightcrawlers? Do not try to use nightcrawlers or other worms native to Nebraska to stock your worm bin. These worms depend on cooler temperatures and an extensive tunneling system to survive. They will die in your worm bin  Why Redworms? Redworms prefer temperatures between 55 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit and are suited to living in a worm bin. The temperature of the bedding should not be allowed to get below freezing or above 84 degrees.  How Many Worms Do I Need? The amount of worms needed will depend on the amount of kitchen waste generated per day. One pound of redworms will easily take care of each half-pound of garbage. To add worms to the bin, simply scatter them over the top. The skin on the worm reacts to light and they will immediately work their way down into the bedding to get away from the light.  Kitchen Waste:   The kitchen waste fed to worms can come from a variety of sources, including all vegetable and fruit waste (don't be surprised that some seeds may germinate and potato peels with eyes sprout), pasta leftovers, coffee grounds (with filter) and tea bags. Worms may have a problem with garlic and onion skins. Worms have a gizzard like chickens so fine grit should be added to help the worms digest food. This gritty material includes cornmeal, coffee grounds and/or finely crushed egg shells (dry the shells and then crush). Avoid large amounts of fat, meat scraps or bone. Some sources feel that a small amount of meat and eggs will provide protein to the worms, but be careful you don't overdo it and know that you may attract rodents.  Adding Kitchen Scraps:   First, and foremost, START SLOWLY . It will take time for bacteria to form and your bin can quickly become very smelly if you add too much food, too fast. In the beginning, add a very small amount of gritty material (see above) and a small amount of vegetable matter. Don't worry about the worms starving because they will be eating bedding as well. You can gradually increase the amount of food as the bin becomes established.  The easiest method is to spread the scraps in a thin layer on top of the bedding. If the bin is kept in a dark place or covered, the worms will come to the surface to eat. You can also pull back a small amount of bedding in the bin and dump in the scraps. Cover the scraps with an inch of bedding. Start at one corner of the bin and bury garbage in a pattern to fill in all the spaces. By the time you get back to the first burying spot, the worms will have composted most of the waste.  If you notice odors, cut back on the amount of food or try chopping the food up into smaller pieces. Note: citrus does have a strong odor and the peelings seem to last a long time in the bin. Bins seem to be more manageable when there is less fruit and citrus and more of the leafy vegetables.  Harvesting the Compost:   Given the right environment, the worms will go to work to digest the kitchen scraps and bedding faster than any other compost method. The material will pass through the worms' bodies and become "castings." In about 3-4 months, the worms will have digested nearly all the garbage and bedding and the bin will be filled with a rich, black natural fertilizer and soil amendment. Compared to ordinary soil, the worm castings contain five times more nitrogen, seven times more phosphorus and 11 times more potassium. They are rich in humic acids and improve the structure of the soil.  To keep your bin going, you will need to remove the castings from time to time and there are several ways to go about it. One way to do this is to shine a bright light into the bin. The worms are sensitive to light and will move to the lower layers of the bin. Remove the top layer of casting by using your hands or a sieve. Each time you remove some bedding, the worms will be exposed to the light and they will keep migrating down to the bottom of the bin. Pick out any wigglers or worm eggs (small, opaque cocoons) and return them to the bin. Refill the bin with fresh layers of moist bedding and food.  Another method of harvesting composts is to push the black, decomposed material to one side of the bin, and fill the other side with new, moist bedding and kitchen scraps. Then wait several days. The worms will migrate to the freshly filled side of the bin and you can just scoop out the finished compost. Make sure you pick out any wigglers or worm eggs and return them to the bin.  Try the "onion bag" method to harvest your worms. Visit the City Farmer Web site .  Using the Compost:   For potted plants, add a thin layer to the top of the potting soil. You can also add the compost directly into your soil mix when repotting. In the garden, simply work it into the ground around the base of each plant. The compost is very mild and you won't have to worry about accidental burning or overfertilizing.  Some Don'ts:   **Don't put plastic bags, bottle caps, rubber bands, sponges, aluminum foil and glass in the bin. These materials will be there forever and make your worm bin look like trash.  **Don't let your cat use your worm bin as a litter box. First, cat urine would soon make the odor intolerable. Secondly, the ammonia in the urine could kill your worms. There is also a concern with toxoplasmosis, a disease that is of particular concern to a pregnant woman who may pass on the disease to her unborn child. If you have cats, provide a screen or other device to keep them from using the worm bin as a litter box.  **Don't use insecticides around your worm bin. You'll not only take care of a few pests, but also your worms.  **Don't use garden soil as bedding for the worms.  **Don't mix fresh cow, horse and especially chicken manure into your bedding. These manures will heat up the bedding and literally cook your worms.  Other...   After you've had your worm bin established, you may begin noticing other creatures besides the redworms - especially if you keep your bin outdoors. Most of these are helpful because they help breakdown the materials. These helpful creatures include springtails, sowbugs and pill bugs, and millipedes.  There are also some creatures that may cause you problems. These would include centipedes, predatory mites, fruit flies, rove beetles and ants. Nonlethal methods of control (swatting, traps for fruit flies and ants, etc.) are the best for areas around your worm bins. Rodents are not a problem when the bin is constructed and managed properly.  In Mary Appelhof's book "Worms Eat My Garbage", she suggests that if you are allergic to molds and mildew, you may want to keep your home bin outside or away from living areas. Molds and mildew are part of the composting cycle that help to break down organic materials and naturally occur in a worm bin.  References *Worms Eat My Garbage, Mary Appelhof.

			over 30 years experience in breeding exhibition pure breeds - 
			essential facts if you have not kept a goose before. These points 
			are the result of the most frequently asked questions about 
			management as pets and in the garden. What do I need to transport geese? How often should I treat geese for worms? What do geese eat? Why do they need grit? What do I do if they become ill? How long will they live? Should I let the goose sit?  Goose f acts and photos of the breeds  Transporting Geese Birds overheat very rapidly in cardboard boxes in cars in summer 
			heat. They will die even more rapidly than dogs left in stationary 
			cars. This is because of their feathers and the additional 
			insulation of the box. Wire (weldmesh) containers or purpose-made 
			poultry or pet-carriers are best. If cardboard boxes must be used, 
			always cut plenty of air holes, or tie on a wire top to allow free 
			passage of air. Store boxes in the shade, park the car in the shade, 
			and load boxes only when ready to travel. Place the boxes on the 
			shaded side of the car; do not put them in a sealed boot. Ventilate 
			the car well, or use air-conditioning while travelling. Listen to 
			the weather forecast before picking up birds in the summer months 
			and avoid heat-wave conditions for travelling. It is illegal to bind a bird's legs or wings, or to carry it in a 
			sack. The bird should not be loose in the vehicle. A bird distressed by heat should be put on water immediately on 
			release. Worming geese Geese are relatively easy to keep except for one problem, which can 
			be avoided quite easily. Both ducks and geese can get gizzard worm 
			but geese are far more likely to suffer from its effects and die. So 
			always worm geese when buying or selling them. Do make sure that 
			this is not done twice. Gizzard worm is a common parasite and its 
			incidence would be considerably reduced if more people took this 
			precaution. Wormers include the following products.  Levamisole is no longer recommended due to 			resistance of the parasitic worms    Flubenvet is a multi-purpose wormer for waterfowl and poultry. It 
			kills gizzard and gape worm, round worm, caecal worm and tape worm. 
			The wormer is a white powder which adheres well to poultry pellets. 
			The correct dose (given on the packaging for geese) must be fed for 
			7 consecutive days. The advantage of using flubendozole, found in Flubenvet, is that it 
			is easy to administer. It can be used with goslings. The disadvantage is that, with geese in particular, you do not know 
			how much wormer they have consumed if they also graze. It does not give an immediate result if they are ill. Remember to read the information about withdrawal times on the 
			product. Flubenvet can be obtained from the vet, and from suppliers of 
			poultry and game products. Panacur i s not licensed as a poultry wormer but it is obtainable 
			through your vet. It contains fenbendazole which kills the gizzard 
			worm, but not its eggs. Two doses, spaced at 2 -3 weeks are therefore 
			needed to eradicate the pest. It is also less effective than the 
			above two wormers at killing worms in the windpipe (gapes). 
			However:- It is very useful for treating goslings at any age with a single 
			dose, if they become ill with gizzard worm and are not eating. 
			Flubenvet is of no use in this situation. Panacur does not give the side-effects of levamisole. Note that the 10% solution for cattle or cat&dog should be used. 
			[The 2.5% solution for sheep results in a four-fold dose being 
			required and other ingredients may be added.]  It can be given as a 
			drench (see above) or put on food if you watch that the food is 
			consumed. Remember to read the information about withdrawal times on the 
			product.  Birds are unlikely to suffer from gizzard worm if treated when new 
			to the premises and then fed well, or grazed at a low stocking 
			density. However, it is always a good idea to worm a goose just 
			after she has commenced to sit (and the gander) so that if she 
			becomes ill, you then know that it is not worms which are causing 
			the problem. Aim to worm the birds twice a year in total, and 
			observe appropriate withdrawal times if affected products (eggs or 
			meat) were intended for consumption.

I have a pair of day-old goslings. Their mother is 
			still brooding and refuses to help. Could you let me know how I can 
			feed them and what I live in south India where geese are not quite 
			so common. Can I give them broken rice/wheat and do they need a dry 
			or wet feed? The mother still has 4 eggs to hatch; We lost 4 
			goslings earlier as we left them with the mother; These 2 were 
			hatched yesterday and seem to be doing fine but they need to eat; 
			Would appreciate a quick reply; I got your it from the net - 
			Mallika; When the goslings are to be with the mother, will they go out and 
			eat grass? I think this may be the dry season and there is not a lot 
			of green food? Finely broken wheat will be better than rice - especially if the 
			rice is polished rice. Use whole wheat. It does not matter if it is 
			wet or dry, as long as the goslings have water to get to. Just see 
			which way works best. The food keeps in better condition if dry. Do 
			not allow moulds to develop in damp food, especially in the warmer 
			temperatures where you are. Make sure that the goslings have access 
			to grit for the gizzard, to break down the cereal and greens. Coarse 
			sand is useful for this purpose. Also make sure that the goslings cannot fall into the water 
			container and drown. In the UK we feed greens like dandelion leaves, 
			chopped grass, chopped tender cauliflower leaves, but not a lot of 
			lettuce and cabbage. I would not use spinach The easy way here in 
			the UK is to buy manufactured 'baby duck 'crumbs or goose starter 
			crumbs. If the diet is restricted to dry cereals, add supplements 
			like brewers yeast ( not bread yeast) for extra vitamins. It sounds 
			as if the eggs may have been incubated by the goose at different 
			times? It's best to get them all sat on as the same time so that 
			they synchronise their hatching. Geese are sometimes poor mothers, 
			and squash the goslings. You could try using a hen as a broody and 
			foster mother, but hens do carry more external parasites (mites) 
			than geese; so you would have to look after the hen carefully, with 
			respect to parasite control (because these parasites will get on 
			the goslings too) ======================================== Message date : Mar 04 2004, 05:28 AM Re: help for day old goslings  Dear Christine, Thanks ever so much for your advice. The goslings are doing fine. 
			They are now 5 days old and very active. Will take you advice and 
			switch to broken wheat. They have attached themselves to me as their 
			surrogate mother and follow me around when we let them out on the 
			lawn. We have just today made them a temporary run so that they can 
			have a bit more exercise without the hawks and the crows going for 
			them. I had put out a basin of water thinking they might just learn 
			to swim but rushed out and removed it after reading your message. 
			When will they take to water? Their parents are no help at all. 
			Their mother is sitting beside the other goose who has 5 eggs under 
			her and refuses to come out. We did try to introduce them to their 
			fathers who got rather aggressive so have kept them away. We don't 
			get specific duck feed in India. Tried chicken feed from a friend 
			but they don't seem to like it. They are happy with the broken rice, 
			semolina (which is made from wheat) and chopped coriander and 
			lettuce. I am sure when they are old enough they will find what they 
			can eat from the garden. But you are right we are going into the 
			summer and everything is drying fast. Mallika Thanks for your reply. Nice to hear that they are doing well. As 
			long as they get carbohydrate plus greens I'm sure they will be 
			fine. Coriander's a bit of a surprise though! Chick food should be OK as a starter for the first 2 weeks, but they 
			sometimes put additives in it to combat coccidiosis. Occasionally, 
			people believe, this adversely affects waterfowl. However, people 
			reared geese centuries ago just on greens - so I don't see why it 
			should not be good enough now! Get a broad-based water contained - eg a washing-up bowl - when they 
			are big enough to get in and out of it. If you put a brick inside 
			the water, it can act as a stepping stone to get out. At the moment, 
			when they are really small, use a heavy pot casserole - as long as 
			they can step out of it. It's narrow, deep containers where they can 
			get stuck head-down. Ganders can be good fathers - especially if they have Chinese or 
			African in them, but occasionally they can be aggressive to 
			goslings. I would try to get the goose off the nest if she has sat 
			for more than 32 days. [They lose a lot of condition and it's 
			difficult to start them eating properly again.] This would probably 
			involve fencing her off in another area, with the ganders. If you 
			have 2 geese on the nest when the next lot of eggs hatch, they are 
			almost sure to squash the goslings  Note that all photographs and text on this website belong

Please telephone 01938 554011 for availability of books or stock We are in the UK near Shrewsbury on the border of England and Wales. We breed a limited quantity of pure breeds of domestic geese and

			sell hatching eggs.           'Domestic Geese', black & white - first published 
			1999   ' Keeping Geese', in colour, published 2012     Goose food: What do geese eat?  Geese can be kept exclusively on grass, but this should only be 
			practised on free-range on farms where the birds are run extensively 
			and grazed with other animals. A low stocking density for geese 
			reduces the concentration of parasites for them. Parasites are 
			mostly species-specific. The geese will not catch coccidiosis from 
			the sheep, for example.  Grass should be kept short for geese, less than 4 inches. long. 
			Tough grass can cause crop-binding and death. Mow the grass if it is 
			too long, or get larger animals in to eat it. Geese on clean, short 
			grass do not need a lot of supplementary food in spring and summer, 
			but they should be offered a mixture of wheat and pellets, dry, in a 
			bowl, before being shut up for the night. Give as much as they will 
			eat up in 20 minutes; supply a bucket of water for then to drink as 
			well. Dry, powdery mash should not be fed to waterfowl. It gets 
			stuck in the mouth and can lead to 'dropped tongue'.  Wheat is a good all-round food containing more protein than maize, 
			found in 'mixed corn'. Wheat is also cheaper. If the grass is 
			restricted or dirty, wheat on its own can be fed in a larger 
			quantity in a bucket of water, just sufficient for the day. The 
			water prevents most vermin from taking the wheat. Wheat is fed as a 
			basic food at Slimbridge (Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust) in the water, 
			at the water's edge. This is a natural way of feeding waterfowl and 
			wildfowl.  Also feed pellets to geese which will eat them, especially in the 
			breeding season. Pellets can be ordinary poultry layers, but if you 
			can get waterfowl breeder rations locally, supplied by firms such as 
			Allen & Page, BOCM-Pauls etc., so much the better. These 
			companies have web sites with information about their products for 
			waterfowl. The pellets are fed dry in a bowl, and are usually fed 
			mixed with wheat (1:1). Pellets spoil in heavy rain and can go 
			mouldy if damp. Make sure that they are stored correctly, and only 
			put out as many as the geese will eat within the day - or at a 
			specific feeding time.  On zero grazing, geese will eat up to 7 oz of food per day 
			(depending on the size of the goose). Large growing goslings of 
			large strains of Embden will eat 12 oz or more. Geese also like 
			greens such as cauliflower trimmings, small amounts of carrots and 
			potatoes, and bread (not more than 10% of the diet). They do have to 
			acquire a taste for new food though; geese tend to eat what their 
			parents ate. Be careful that geese do not get too fat. A good regime 
			is to feed them only morning and evening and to let them graze for 
			most of the day if they have access to clean grass. More wheat is needed winter because temperatures are lower, and the 
			the grass is poorer quality. Grass should be well managed for geese.   Why do they need grit? All waterfowl and poultry need grit so that their gizzard - a large 
			internal muscle in the digestive system - can mill the food. It is 
			the partial equivalent, in its function, to our teeth. Supply mixed 
			poultry grit containing limestone, oyster shell and flint in the 
			breeding season. This also supplies calcium for the goose. Also 
			supply coarse sand, containing larger pieces of grit, throughout the 
			year. The coarse sand punctures the grass and makes it more 
			digestible. Coarse building sand is suitable This should be pure 
			sand - no additives. If grit is not supplied, geese will look for 
			hard material to pick up, and are even more likely to find bits of 
			old wire and nails in the soil. Avoid problems by providing grit and 
			tidying up any objects likely to cause damage internally.   What do I do if they become ill? The three most common ailments are worms, bad legs and bacterial 
			diseases picked up from wild birds, mice and rats.  If a bird is light or lame, worm it. A single dose of levamisole or 
			Panacur from your vet gives a rapid response. Remember to repeat the 
			dose if Panacur is used (see above). Use flubenvet in the food if 
			the bird is eating well. Birds fed on a good mixed diet of greens and pellets plus wheat (a 
			good mix of vitamins and minerals) rarely go lame. If they do 
			develop a swollen ankle or hock, a course of antibiotic injections 
			from the vet is needed.  If the bird is not eating, or passing watery droppings, get an 
			antibiotic injection from the vet quickly . The more rapid your 
			response, the more likely the recovery of the bird. Also worm the 
			bird when the vet thinks appropriate for the course of antibiotic.  In the breeding season, females are more likely to die than males 
			because of complications in laying eggs. Avoid problems by making 
			sure that geese have access to grit containing calcium (mixed 
			poultry grit - see above) and are fed pellets for breeders or 
			layers, containing calcium and phosphorus in the correct 
			proportions.   How long will they live?  Tales abound of geese living up to 80 years of age. We have found 
			that that 20-22 years is more likely for the average domestic goose. 
			Heavy geese have a shorter life span.   Should I let the goose sit? The goose does not have to go broody. If you keep taking the eggs 
			away, she may not even feel like sitting. If the eggs are left in a 
			clutch, this will encourage her to sit.  Don't forget - geese do need protection from foxes, mink, badger 
			etc., especially at night. Think about housing and fencing to 
			exclude predators. Bedding such as white wood 
			shavings inn the goose shed is hygienic. DO NOT USE EXPANDABLE HORSE 
			BEDDING e.g. hemp, OR  BEDDING WITH EUCALYPTUS. THE FUMES CAN 
			KILL GOSLINGS   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Goose diseases: Goose Parvovirus (Derzsy's Disease) is occasionally reported in the
